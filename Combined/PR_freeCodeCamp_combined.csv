This will be shown on the two English superblock pages as well. We decided that was fine. Decided to just make new keys. Maybe we'll want to revert or use them somewhere else or something.

Added  an extra test case to enforce the following code does not pass as it actually does not form a pyramid
`for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character);
  character.repeat(i);
}`

Extra unnecessary line.  You're right, fixed. ```suggestion

Allow spaces in the `.push` call too. ```suggestion

The `super-block-page` tests seem to be flaky, so this PR is an attempt to stabilize it.

Here is one of many instances: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/actions/runs/12463382673/job/34786051699?pr=57701#step:14:313.

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","The scenario the test is trying to simulate is: when the user visits a challenge page, then navigates back to the super block page, the super block page would expand the block that the user has just visited.

The test is currently executing two `.goto()` calls:

```js
await page.goto('/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game/step-2');

await page.goto('/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8');
```

My guess is the calls are too close to each other. The second navigation happens too fast that the app doesn't have a chance to register the `currentChallengeId`, and without that information, the expanded block on the super block page is not reflected correctly.

So the fix here is to wait for the challenge page to load, as an attempt to slow down the navigation."

Which video is this?
I don't think it should block this PR.
We can just remove that video id from this PR and wait until it is fixed and ready and create a new PR then.
There is already a transcript there so it is fine to have this as is for launch. 

We will also need to mark it as review on the sheet and notify the editor to update it. It will probably happen after Christmas at this point which is fine.  The repetition is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF-fbEMJ1XM) at 0.48
I would like to have it fixed but it's not a big deal @jdwilkin4  Yeah, I vote we fix it and remove it from this PR from now.
Because I can see this issue reported by a camper and we will need to fix it anyway Beau says he's going to fix it. About the private video, he's investigating. Apparently is not set private but it is to me.  > About the private video, he's investigating. Apparently is not set private but it is to me.

It was originally marked draft. 
So that is why it was private to you üëç  Still not able to see that video but it seems anyone else can so I guess we can include it in this PR.

They're all appreciated, Kris. Thank you.For consistency, wherever we are referring to plurals, `""about it""` should be replaced with `""about them.""` 

For example:  
- **Correct:** `""Before you are quizzed on CSS Flexbox concepts, you first need to review what you've learned about it.""`  
   *Reason:* The subject, ""CSS Flexbox concepts,"" is treated as a singular idea here.  

- **Needs Correction:** `""Before you are quizzed on CSS and accessibility, you first need to review what you've learned on it.""`  
   *Suggested Change:* `""Before you are quizzed on CSS and accessibility, you first need to review what you've learned about them.""`  
   *Reason:* ""CSS and accessibility"" refers to two distinct items, so ""about them"" is grammatically accurate.  Hey @Ksound22, thanks for going through this file and updating all of these strings.

","I created similar task for Block 7, and here's what Nielda thought about it: ""i'd not create a task asking a definition of something unless the character is explaining it. Instead, you can use a type 22 and define the vocab inside the explanation section.""

OR you can create type 19 with `What is the maintenance team planning to do this weekend?` ```suggestion
This word means observing or keeping track of something, especially to ensure it is functioning correctly. It ends in `-ing`.
```
Changed to keep the consistency of the entire curriculum. ```suggestion
The `Future Continuous` tense describes actions that will be ongoing at a specific point in the future. It is formed using `will be` + verb ending in `-ing`. For example:
````
`verb-ing` might be confusing for learners and localisation. ```suggestion
The `Future Continuous` tense with the structure `will be` + verb ending in `-ing` describes actions that will be ongoing at a specific point in the future.
```
Same as above. ```suggestion
This phrase of two words means a system or network gets overloaded with too much traffic, making it unable to work properly or respond to real users. The first word is the abbreviation of `Denial of Service`.
```
`abbreviation` makes more sense. ```suggestion
Which sentence correctly uses the `Future Continuous` tense to describe what Jessica will do?
``` ```suggestion
The `Future Continuous` tense is used to describe an ongoing action that will happen in the future. Its structure is `will be` + verb ending in `-ing`.
``` ```suggestion
`The server hosts the company's website.` - This means the server is responsible for storing and delivering the website's content to users who access it.
``` ```suggestion
`The system crashed because it couldn't handle the high load during peak hours.` - This means the system became overwhelmed due to the large amount of demand placed on it.
``` ```suggestion
What will Brian be doing?
```
`might` suggests probability, while Brian is certain about his plans. ```suggestion
What will they be doing?
```
They are sure about their plans. ```suggestion
Backing up data is important, but the task here is not about it.
```
This feedback gives away the answer. ```suggestion
Jessica expresses no concerns about the plan's success.
``` ```suggestion
The audio does not mention fixing bugs.
```
This feedback gives away the answer. ```suggestion
The audio specifies that they will do something else, not just monitor the system.
```
This feedback gives away the answer. ```suggestion
Brian's concern is not about the server's performance.
```
This feedback gives away the answer. ```suggestion
No, he thinks it's unnecessary to inform users in advance.
``` ```suggestion
Brian clearly agrees with Jessica's plan, calling it a `Good idea`.
``` ```suggestion
Brian's response, `Good idea`, shows he agrees with Jessica's plan to inform users in advance. He emphasizes the importance of avoiding user frustration by ensuring they are aware of the maintenance ahead of time.
``` ```suggestion
Place the following phrases in the correct spot:

`I'll`, `joining`, `monitoring`, `testing`, `be`, and `going`.
```
We usually add an empty line here. ```suggestion
`Brian: It's going to start around 2 AM and should last a couple of hours. We'll be BLANK the server load to ensure it's stable.`
``` ```suggestion
`Jessica: Yes, BLANK send out a notification to our users, letting them know about the maintenance window. It's better to inform them in advance.`
``` ```suggestion
This word describes Brian's ongoing action of checking the system during the maintenance.
``` ```suggestion
This word indicates Jessica's plan to participate in the maintenance.
``` ```suggestion
This contraction refers to Jessica's intention to send a notification to users.
``` ```suggestion
After discussing with Brian, Jessica wrote this scheduled maintenance notification:
```
It looks like an introduction to the reading text, so there shouldn't be backticks. ```suggestion
`Thank you,`
`Support Team`
```
There's no need to add an empty line. ```suggestion
The text does not mention adding new features.
```
This feedback gives away the answer. ```suggestion
Although security measures are part of the process, the text mentions something else.
```
This feedback gives away the answer. ```suggestion
The text does not mention downtime during peak hours.
```
This feedback gives away the answer."

","```suggestion
A `Denial of Service (DoS)` attack is a cyber-attack intended to make a network or service unavailable to its intended users, usually by overwhelming it with traffic. This type of attack disrupts normal service, causing slowdowns or complete outages. For example:
``` ```suggestion
`Firewall settings` are the specific rules or configurations used to manage network security. For example:
``` Miya used this case for DoS in Block 6 so I think we should follow it across the curriculum. ```suggestion
To prevent Denial of Service attacks.
``` ```suggestion
He emphasizes prevention, specifically mentioning `Denial of Service attacks` as the potential risk.
``` ```suggestion
Maria's statement, `Yes, Jake, I've reviewed the timetable`, shows she has already checked or looked over the schedule for the system update. `To review` something means to examine or go over it carefully. For example:
``` ```suggestion
In Maria's sentence, `at its lowest` refers to the lowest level of user traffic for the server.
``` ```suggestion
Maria states that the server downtime starts when `the user traffic is at its lowest`. This indicates the downtime is planned for a time with minimal user activity, likely to reduce the impact on users. 
``` The part `Yes, Jake, I've reviewed the timetable.` isn't in the scene, but it doesn't affect the task overall. ```suggestion
This modal verb is used to express an expectation or likelihood of something happening.
``` ```suggestion
`Enhance` means to improve something or make it more effective. For example:
``` ```suggestion
This word refers to the process of making something stronger or more secure. It ends in `-ing`.
```
Changed to keep the consistency. ```suggestion
He mentions `minimize disruption` and `strengthening our defenses`, which clearly outline what the update aims to achieve. 
``` ```suggestion
This phrase means being available online to provide support or help if needed.
```
I'd add `online` to be more specific. ```suggestion
`On call` means being available online to provide help or support if necessary.
``` ```suggestion
The support team might be on call during the update.
```
Since Maria is asking a question, she can't be sure about their availability. ```suggestion
`Handle` means to deal with or manage a task or situation effectively.  
``` ```suggestion
```
This task contains two explanations. ```suggestion
To answer correctly, focus on her use of the words `ready to handle` and `immediate issues`, which indicate her intention for proactive problem-solving.
``` ```suggestion
This word indicates the `Future Simple` tense. 
``` ```suggestion
Infinitive form of verb `to be`.
``` ```suggestion
The sentence uses `will` to indicate the `Future Simple` tense, showing that the action is expected to happen. 
``` ```suggestion
Focus on the word `entire` in his statement.
```
Jake is talking, not Maria. ```suggestion
To find the correct answer, focus on the key phrase: `the entire technical support team`. This emphasizes that no one is excluded from being on duty.
``` ```suggestion
This word means being given detailed information or instructions about a task or situation. It ends in `-ed`.
```
To keep the consistency. ```suggestion
This word describes something that happens without warning or is not anticipated. It ends in `-ed`.
``` ```suggestion
To find the correct answer, listen for the key phrase in Jake's statement: `prepared to manage any unexpected situations`. This shows that the team was briefed to handle unplanned or surprising events.
``` ```suggestion
```
The correct answer doesn't require feedback. ```suggestion
`And when does the team perform the final checks?` uses the `Present Simple` tense (`does perform`) to ask about a scheduled future event. 

The correct answer, `The final system checks are set for Friday night`, also uses the `Present Simple` to describe a fixed plan. 

`Present Simple` is often used for future events that are part of a schedule or timetable. For example:

- `The train departs at 8 PM tonight.` - This indicates a scheduled departure.

- `Our meeting starts tomorrow morning.` - This shows a planned time for a future event.

In this context, the `Present Simple` makes the answer concise and appropriate for discussing a fixed event.
``` ```suggestion
Jake says, `The final system checks are set for Friday night`. The phrase `are set for` indicates a future event, and `Friday night` specifies the exact time. To answer correctly, focus on the timing mentioned in the statement and note that it refers to a planned, scheduled future event.

- Ie. element `#ingredient` element will be automatically accessible by `ingredient` variable.

- _Affected_ variables were renamed.","```suggestion
You can finally start hooking your logic into the user interface. You'll need to query the DOM to get a few elements by ID. Get the elements with the `ingredient`, `quantity`, `unit`, `servings`, `recipe-form`, and `result-list` IDs, and assign them to the variables `ingredientName`, `quantityInUnit`, `unitToConvert`, `numberOfServings`, `recipeForm`, and `resultList`, respectively.

Firstly, thank you for submitting this pull request!

As you navigate through the process, we have a PR checklist to ensure consistency and quality in our contributions. We kindly ask that you genuinely follow through with each point. This not only facilitates the review process but also demonstrates a mutual respect for the community's efforts.

If you're unfamiliar with certain aspects, our [contributing guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org) are a helpful resource to get you up to speed.

<details>
<summary>**Friendly Pointers (click to expand)**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Editing on GitHub:** While it's possible to edit files directly on GitHub, it's typically better not to. This helps avoid inadvertent mistakes like typos that can disrupt tests.
2. **Pull Request Title:** Please ensure the PR title follows [our convention](/how-to-open-a-pull-request/#prepare-a-good-pr-title).
3. **Linking Issues:** Please ensure you link issues using the designated method. Simply update the `XXXXXX` in the PR description to include the issue number. This keeps our records organized and clear.
4. **Engaging with the Team:** We know you're eager, but kindly keep mentions and review requests limited. Our maintainers are always on the lookout and will attend to PRs in the order they come in.
5. **Branch Management:** It's a good practice not to work directly off your `main` branch. Creating separate branches for different changes allows you to smoothly update your PR even as the main repository progresses.

Let's consider Task 1 in Learn Conversation Starters in the Break Room. If I was reading these examples out loud to someone, I would probably not say ""right arrow"". I would probably say something like ""The statement ... becomes the question ..."". Or if you want to use the same wording as in the sentence that introduces these examples, something like: ""The statement ... turns into the question ..."". 

I'm not suggesting we add all of this hidden text, but I think I would be leaning towards at least adding alt text for the arrow, probably going with ""turns into the question"" for these specific examples. I also think [WCAG SC 1.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html#dfn-non-text-content) technically requires alt text for the arrow since unicode characters are generally considered to be non-text content.

Another option might be to turn this into a table of two columns, one for the statement and one for the question. Then you wouldn't need the arrow at all and I think it would be clear to everyone what is being presented, with no additional helper text needed.

| Statement         | Question     |
|--------------|-----------|
|He is here.      |Is he here?   |
|They are ready.      |Are they ready?  | @bbsmooth Appreciate your feedback as always üôÇ 

> I don't have a mac or iPhone so I can't test VoiceOver but I'm assuming it is probably OK.

I'm on a mac and can confirm that VoiceOver announces the symbol as ""right arrow"".

However, I think turning the text into a table is a great approach. It doesn't require additional text, but still communicates the mapping clearly.

---

I have a new puzzle for you, though üòÑ 

I found that we're using `->` in other places as well, and it's for representing steps:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/0adcf7d59bb6735b7bba95cc747b8f6ad902cb50/curriculum/challenges/english/25-front-end-development/quiz-git/66f1b06a5a5d10cc100af620.md#L212

</details>

The only option I have in mind right now is turning this into an `ol`. But I'm wondering what you think should be a better approach in this case. what about just commas: `` `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` ``
result: `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` I like Tom's idea. I was playing around with a few possibilities over the weekend and I pretty much came to the same conclusion. The comma will cause a screen reader to give a slight pause, so I think a screen reader user would be able to distinguish each command. I gave this a quick revisit. I think that, yea, for something like the git quiz, the commas work - e.g: `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`

But for the English lessons on this PR, I would be fine with the table idea, but just adding more text works as well - e.g:
`He is here.` becomes `Is he here?`
`They are ready.` becomes `Are they ready?`

Either way works. Dealers choice. I went ahead and replaced the arrows with tables in English challenges.

The description now looks something like this:

We're using a hyphen and a greater than symbol to represent a right arrow (`->`). Visually this is okay, but screen readers would announce this as ""greater than"".

This PR changes the combination to an actual right arrow (screen readers would announce this as ""right arrow"").

Alternatively, I think we could just say ""From X to Y"" and get rid of the symbol.

`He does`, `she does`, and `it does`.

I think if there are multiple examples, maybe we would be better off with displaying them in a table, so that it's a bit easier to present the mapping:

| Affirmative | Interrogative |
| --- | --- |
| `He is here.` | `Is he here?` |
| `They are ready.` | `Are they ready?` |

And perhaps if there is just one example, we could have the annotation as you suggested:

```md
Affirmative: ...
Interrogative: ...

? @huyenltnguyen I think this option is excellent. I wasn't aware we could add tables. If you make these changes they would definitely work.  "

The fix applies to the super block page (you know, the page that lists the content/blocks of a certification). We have multiple display types that can be used to display blocks, and link blocks are those that presented as a single link.

Here is an example of `LegacyLinkBlock`: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#build-a-survey-form-project.

As for `LinkBlock`, it's currently used in the new curriculum only and the new curriculum isn't released yet. You'll need to:
- Set the `SHOW_NEW_CURRICULUM` and `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES` variables in the `.env` file to `true` (I _think_ one of these should work, but I don't remember which one, so let's just flip both üòù ).
- Start the dev environment and go to `http://localhost:8000/learn/full-stack-developer/#review-basic-html`, which is one of the blocks rendered using the `LinkBlock`  component.

In LinkBlock and LegacyLinkBlock, we show a `CheckMark` next to the block title, but the CheckMark component hides its content from screen readers: 

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/5f4fd05580f4baf1ca0f777154d5c305a816439a/client/src/templates/Introduction/components/check-mark.tsx#L6-L9

This prevents screen readers from reading the `aria-label` of the icon, and allows us to apply different completion states to the block title (for example, in grid-based blocks, the states can be ""not started"", ""X% completed"", or ""completed"").

However, LinkBlock and LegacyLinkBlock currently don't have any alternative text for the completion state, so this information is not available for non-sighted users.

This PR addresses this issue.

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","Instead of adding alternative text, we could allow `CheckMark` to show the accessible text.

I'm not doing that, however, because `CheckMark` conditionally renders `GreenPass` and `GreenNotCompleted`, and their label text are ""Passed"" and ""Not passed"", which I think are more appropriate in the context of challenge tests than the completion state.

This PR:
- Updates the `getChosenBlock` in the super block component to improve the auto-expand behavior
- Closes #55934
  - The changes in this PR don't exactly address the issue, but I think this is the best / closest to the expected behavior we can do

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","Initially the `getChosenBlock` function is declared above `allChallenges`, `challenges`, etc. 

I want to use those variables inside the function, so what's changed here is I moved the function a little further down. This is a new constant I created, to grab the challenges relevant to the super block from all of the completed challenges. It took me a while to figure this out. I did see the `currentChallengeId` in local storage, but for some reason the value isn't saved in redux even though we do add the value to the store during the initialization:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/144cf138c3551c4bfa5650abc99fe06babdb7e1c/client/src/redux/index.js#L56

Apparently the value is overridden when the `fetchUserComplete` action happens.

`user.currentChallengeId` is always an empty string because we have stopped recording / returning the value (#46042). Just a minor performance improvement here.

Instead of finding the `currentChallengeId` in all challenges (`nodes`), I changed it to just all challenges of the target super block (`challenges`). We only save one current challenge, so there is a high chance that the challenge isn't in the super block we're looking at.

In this case, we find the last completed challenge of the super block instead. With `firstChallenge` being:

```ts
const firstChallenge = nodes[0]?.challenge;
```

and `nodes[0]` is step 1 of Cat Photo App, `firstChallenge?.block` would always be the Cat Photo App block, which is only applicable to the RWD super block.

I changed this to `blocks[0]` instead, with `blocks` is the blocks of the target super block. Skipped if `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES !== true` so that the tests won't fail in CI, but it's still possible to run the tests locally.

I have created #57506 to track the removable of `test.skip()`. I'm adding tests for both the existing behavior as well as the new behavior.

Just to aid the review process, here are the test cases:

<img width=""649"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-12-14 at 00 45 12"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df048d43-747c-4ecd-82b5-e1efac5bfc9b"" />
 ```suggestion
```
Challenge completion doesn't affect `currentChallengeId` except that it causes you to visit another challenge and we already do that. ```suggestion
    test('should expand the block of the most recently viewed challenge', async ({
```
`currentChallengeId` is stored on challenge mount. ```suggestion
```
Not necessary if we're not using the editor. ```suggestion
```
Same again; we don't need to complete a challenge, just visit it. ```suggestion
  const superBlockChallenges = useMemo(
```
There are a lot of types of challenges! I think it's helpful to make it self-descriptive. ```suggestion
        const lastCompletedChallenge = allChallenges.find(
          ({ id }) => id === lastCompletedChallengeId
        );
```
Since we have `allChallenges`, we can simplify this a bit. ```suggestion
```
If we get to the end of the block it returns `blocks[0]` anyway."

I've attempted to reword the instructions to make it clearer where the `taskData.forEach()` was actually coming from since it could take a little bit of scrolling to find. I've also allowed the `forEach` call to optionally end in a semi-colon. 

These changes were applied both to the regular project and the workshop. ","There are multiple nouns in the sentence, so I think it's probably a bit hard to understand which noun the word ""it"" refers to.

Would this be a little better?

```suggestion
Use arrow syntax to create an `updateTaskContainer` function. Then move the `taskData.forEach()` and its content from the `taskForm`'s `submit` event listener into the newly created function.

To reproduce... 
1. Go to the FSD superblock page where the URL includes one of the scrollable anchor hashes, e.g: `http://localhost:8000/learn/full-stack-developer/#lecture-welcome-to-freecodecamp`
2. Scroll down until just **before** the hash in the URL is removed
3. Expand one of the other chapters/modules
4. Get auto-scrolled back to the top of the block with the hash

<details><summary>gif</summary>

![Dec-20-2024 12-01-46](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d3eb14-3965-40da-8150-306a27e56495)

</details>

If the hash isn't in the URL, it works fine. This is a bit of a hack, but I changed the layout on all the new block layouts for the FSD so that the scrollable anchor only contains one element that doesn't have any height (old block layouts didn't change). So you won't ever see the hash in the URL when scrolling down the superblock page, but you can still go to a URL with a hash and get taken to the block. e.g: open `http://localhost:8000/learn/full-stack-developer/#lecture-welcome-to-freecodecamp` and it will take you to the `lecture-welcome-to-freecodecamp` block, and the URL immediately changes to `http://localhost:8000/learn/full-stack-developer/` - so expanding something else won't scroll you away.

Not sure if it's the best solution, but it fixes some pretty annoying behavior.

This PR:
- Corrects the return values of the `/certificate/showCert` endpoint (it's currently not returning the `name` property)
- Adds some tests for the response of endpoint
- Closes #57616

## Investigation notes

If `showName` is `true`, the endpoint will return both user's `name` and `username`. Otherwise, it will only return `username`.

I went to https://www.freecodecamp.dev/certification/fccf064ea61-53d7-44b7-9051-7f4bc75e2702/responsive-web-design (the page that Yoko was testing with) and checked the API responses.
- /get-public-profile returns:
  ```js
  {
    profileUI: {
      showName: true
    }
  }
  ```
- But `/certificate/showCert` doesn't return the `name` property:

I don't really understand why, but I could fix the issue by changing the schema from:

```js
Type.Union([
  {
    a: Type.String(),
  },
  {
    a: Type.String(),
    b: Type.String(),  
  }
])
```

to:

```js
{
  a: Type.String(),
  b: Type.Optional(Type.String()),  
}
```

        expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('username', 'foobar');
        expect(response.body).not.toHaveProperty('name');
```
We don't really need to worry about the other properties. `name` is the one we're interested in. ```suggestion
        expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('name', 'foobar');

Thanks for bringing that up. I forgot about that conversation.

Here is what we should do.

For the MVP launch, let's just leave this as is.
Then after launch, refactor it to a newspaper lab. Here is the issue for that 
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/670

This isn't the first lab they will encounter in the curriculum. They have to get through all of HTML and most of CSS before they reach this part. Even if some want to randomly jump to the grid that would be tiny minority that it is not much of a concern.

As long as the refactor happens in January of next year, then most campers will only ever see the revised newspaper version anyway.  



 You have a lot of unresolved comments, are you stuck on something? I think we want to change the challengeType to 25 here. [See PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/57441)I had a brief look and remembered that we have a workshop and a lab in this module with almost the same title. We briefly discussed about modifying this lab in some way. See this conversation: https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAVgjQ1iA/TYbRFIcNm5E/TYbRFIcNm5E?cls=10

Do we still want to do that? @jdwilkin4 I hope there's time.
 We don't use this style of title that include the topic for this cert I left a few suggestions to improve tests. Some of them don't check what is asked.

Also, you can fulfill all the tests and pass without having actual content showing on the page.  Okay, after this it should be good to go :+1:  LGTM :tada: ","I had a brief look and remembered that we have a workshop and a lab in this module with almost the same title.

Waiting for approval of some videos.

Still to update for this module:

- [x] How Do You Create New Nodes Using innerHTML() and createElement()?
- [x] How Do You Open and Close Dialog Elements Using JavaScript?
- [x] What Is the Web Animations API, and How Does It Relate to CSS Animation Properties?
- [x] What Is the Canvas API, and How Does It Work?
- [x] What Is the Change Event, and How Does It Work?
- [x] How Do Event Bubbling, and Event Delegation Work?
","This is minor, but I noticed that the video is called ""What are events and how does the addEventListener method work"" instead of just ""How Does the addEventListener Method Work"".

I guess we should update the challenge title here? (Doesn't have to be in this PR, though.) There's a lot of videos title that don't match the challenge title exactly. I don't think it's an issue - many of the video titles don't have perfect punctuation and capitalization. I would just leave it.

Side note, I was playing around with trying to hide the youtube info from our videos. Youtube doesn't like that. I did get something to work, but it wasn't good enough."

 Will you also add Instagram and Linkedin? Or at least Linkeding, considering that Instagram would need the conversion to image and I don't know how much work that is Sure I can try to take on the LinkedIn button.  Wait.  I don't actually know how to add LinkedIn buttons for clearing a challenge; nor how they're supposed to appear on the profile page.

    <p>
      Take a moment to review the security alert above. Review the linked
      package source code to understand the potential risk. Ensure the package
      is not malicious before proceeding. If you're unsure how to proceed, reach
      out to your security team or ask the Socket team for help at support [AT]

      <strong> Remove the package </strong>
    </summary>
    <p>
      If you happen to install a dependency that Socket reports as <a href=""https://socket.dev/npm/issue/malware"">Known Malware</a> you should immediately remove it and select a different dependency. For other alert types, you may may wish to investigate alternative packages or consider if there are other ways to mitigate the specific risk posed by the dependency.

Didn't really run into any issues. Left one suggestion - A couple other things I wrote down...

We could maybe include the URL to the sound files so people don't have to open and copy it? Feels like that would be a lot of text - maybe there's a way to just include the base URL once. Maybe something like, ""audio samples you can use for your drum machine can be found at `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/drum/<filename>.mp3` - then a small table with the titles you have and the filename to go with it? I noticed the titles don't match the filename - so maybe it's just best how you have it. I think it's fine as it is, but feel free to make adjustments if you want.

The other thing I wrote down is that I noticed a lot of ""you should have another `div` with an id of `pad-bank`"" in the user stories and test text. Not sure if this is common in the other labs and challenges, but I would either use `ID` (no backticks) if we want it as an abbreviation for ""identification"", or  `` `id` `` (backticks) if we want it as the `id` attribute. Either way works, but the lowercase id doesn't seem right to me without the code highlight. Pretty minor, I would be fine without changing those as well. Your call. I think I would vote to use ID so there isn't as many code blocks.","Pretty fun @ilenia-magoni üéâ

Didn't really run into any issues. Left one suggestion - A couple other things I wrote down...

We could maybe include the URL to the sound files so people don't have to open and copy it? Feels like that would be a lot of text - maybe there's a way to just include the base URL once. Maybe something like, ""audio samples you can use for your drum machine can be found at `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/drum/<filename>.mp3` - then a small table with the titles you have and the filename to go with it? I noticed the titles don't match the filename - so maybe it's just best how you have it. I think it's fine as it is, but feel free to make adjustments if you want.

The other thing I wrote down is that I noticed a lot of ""you should have another `div` with an id of `pad-bank`"" in the user stories and test text. Not sure if this is common in the other labs and challenges, but I would either use `ID` (no backticks) if we want it as an abbreviation for ""identification"", or  `` `id` `` (backticks) if we want it as the `id` attribute. Either way works, but the lowercase id doesn't seem right to me without the code highlight. Pretty minor, I would be fine without changing those as well. Your call. I think I would vote to use ID so there isn't as many code blocks.","Checklist:

```js
const temp = console.log
console.log = /* function that saves the output */
printGreeting();
console.log = temp
assert... /* check the saved output */
```

what you wrote may be needed if the console.log is in the global scope, it's not needed for these steps tho The goal of the two tests was to make sure that `printGreeting` was called in the global scope. I may need to reword the hint text but it was very much intended. 

My logic was that if the function is called in the global scope (that is outside and beloe the function) , it will output to the console and prove the camper did things correctly.  it is to check if the function is being called... there should be really a different way > it is to check if the function is being called... there should be really a different way

I wanted to check for a side effect.  It's possible I missed something.  if you want to check if the function is being called you can replace the function itself instead of console.log and have it flip a variable from false to true but because is in the global scope you still need to do it in --before-user-code--
now I wonder, the code is available as a string in the `code` variable, could that be used to execute the code in a test? > if you want to check if the function is being called you can replace the function itself

I actually can't do that. The variable used to hold the `printGreeting` function is a constant.  That's inconvienient... that remains using the `code` variable I guess I'd rather double check that the index of the function call is greater than the index of the function itself than arbitrarily run code inside of a test case. please simplify",please simplify,"Checklist:

Yeah, I was vaguely aware that there was some light controversy. A bit of googling suggests it's common in US English, though. @moT01 sure, that makes sense.  Can we update the contribution site with a style guide? If the curriculum team broadly agrees, that is.I saw a couple of minor things. 

Also, I think we should be consistent about contractions and commas in lists. For example, we use both ""You'll"" and ""You will"". Also, I _believe_ it's standard in US English to write lists like this ""stuff, whatsits, and more"", rather than ""stuff, whatsits and more"". LGTM :+1: Thanks, Zaira! Lets go with it. 

I usually prefer the oxford comma - depends on the context though.
I also usually prefer not to use contractions - I think it sounds more professional.
But I'm fine with this for now üëç ","I saw a couple of minor things.

So I don't know if this means the link id will change but it is something to make note of. Hopefully it is resolved before this PR is ready for review. But if not, it shouldn't block this PR but we will need to create a separate issue to update the video link if necessary I've been trying to add these after all the videos for a block are created - just to try and keep things simple. I would say we can just wait with this PR until those two are fixed. By then, there may be a few other finished blocks that I can add to this PR.

- Working with CSS Transforms, Overflow, and Filters lecture block
- Understanding how to work with floats and positioning in CSS lecture block

If we are able to get the real videos great, otherwise at least we have transcripts for now.

It makes everything through the end of React Fundamentals visible and available. With the exception of the welcome block, and the three prep exams - which are labelled as ""Coming soon"". After that, everything else is coming soon. I also added the Front end libraries review and exam as coming soon, as well as the final exam as coming soon.

I think this is about what it will look like for release. We can make PR's to add the rest of the content up to the end of the react fundamentals section. e.g. update all the video id's - or add transcripts where we don't have the videos ready. Add the last two labs. And hopefully add the first three exams.

Be sure to set `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES=false` in your `.env` to test this - and it will look the same as it will on staging and, when we release, production.

Firstly, thank you for submitting this pull request!

As you navigate through the process, we have a PR checklist to ensure consistency and quality in our contributions. We kindly ask that you genuinely follow through with each point. This not only facilitates the review process but also demonstrates a mutual respect for the community's efforts.

If you're unfamiliar with certain aspects, our [contributing guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org) are a helpful resource to get you up to speed.

<details>
<summary>**Friendly Pointers (click to expand)**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Editing on GitHub:** While it's possible to edit files directly on GitHub, it's typically better not to. This helps avoid inadvertent mistakes like typos that can disrupt tests.
2. **Pull Request Title:** Please ensure the PR title follows [our convention](/how-to-open-a-pull-request/#prepare-a-good-pr-title).
3. **Linking Issues:** Please ensure you link issues using the designated method. Simply update the `XXXXXX` in the PR description to include the issue number. This keeps our records organized and clear.
4. **Engaging with the Team:** We know you're eager, but kindly keep mentions and review requests limited. Our maintainers are always on the lookout and will attend to PRs in the order they come in.
5. **Branch Management:** It's a good practice not to work directly off your `main` branch. Creating separate branches for different changes allows you to smoothly update your PR even as the main repository progresses.

</Steps>

Please note, there's no need to close this PR. If you have questions or need guidance refining your contribution, don't hesitate to ask. Our community is here to assist.

 That's because current `21` checks against string without the new line character at the end. I'm seeing two options:
1. Strip tailing new lines, from string returned by function, in the current `21` test.
2. Swap tests order, so new line is checked first, then the category names.

I think I like second one more. they would still both fail, and it can be confusing, I would guess you can implement both?

Using `isPlaying` to start the scene playing is a bit counter-intuitive: you'd expect it to track the state of the scene, not cause it to start.

My first attempt at fixing this https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/57295 meant we suddenly had to deal with `null` scenes, which wasn't pretty. 

This PR makes use of the observer pattern so that we can keep all the scene state inside scene and allow any component to start the scene playing, via a `.notify` call. This means we don't have to handle null `scene` data, except insofar as we don't create the scene component. Also, we can share the `SceneSubject` with anything that needs to start the scene - at the moment, hotkeys and an on-click listener in Scene.

Also, it should make it easier to implement pausing (ref: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/55293) since it's easy to extend the subject to notify based on different events.

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","I am not sure if this has any impact, but do we not want this:

```suggestion
    if (canPauseRef.current) {
      audioRef.current.pause();
      canPauseRef.current = false;
    }
``` They're equivalent, so we can use whichever. If `current` is `true`, then both versions set it to `false`. If `current` is `false`, then the unnested version sets it to `false` again, which doesn't matter. I don't mind which version we go with, honestly."

This removes jQuery from the Basic CSS Challenges and using modern ChaiJS assertions. In addition a test involving `style` was updated that was broken.

There is a default style element on the preview pages now  that has a class of `fcc-hide-header`. Tests to see if the camper has created a proper style element have been broken because it will always grab the `style.fcc-hide-header` one first.

In the `Simple Past`, regular verbs like `check` are formed by adding `-ed` to the base verb. Irregular verbs, such as `make`, have unique forms that do not follow this rule. In James's sentence:

Changed a bit because I think it would be better for understanding. But if you don't like it, feel free to reject.  ```suggestion
The `Past Continuous` tense often emphasizes the duration or background of an action in the past. It is used to describe an action that was ongoing at a specific time in the past.  The structure is: **`was`/`were` + verb ending in `-ing`**. 

In Jake‚Äôs sentence, `I was reviewing` shows that the action of reviewing was in progress yesterday. Another example: 

`She was testing the new feature when the system crashed.` - Here, the crashing of the system happened in the middle of her action of testing the new feature - the test was a longer ongoing action.

This is the auxiliary verb used to form the `Past Continuous` in the plural first-person form.
``` ```suggestion
This is the main verb in the `Past Continuous`, describing an ongoing action of improving or modernizing something.
``` ```suggestion
The `Past Continuous` tense is used to describe actions that were ongoing at a specific time in the past. When two `Past Continuous` sentences are used together, they often describe simultaneous actions or actions happening alongside each other.  
``` ```suggestion
`Checked` is the past form of the regular verb `check`, indicating an action that was completed in the past. For example: 

`He checked his email before the meeting.` - He looked at the e-mails at a moment in the past prior to the meeting.

`Made` is the past form of the irregular verb `make`, indicating something that was created or done in the past. For example: 

`She made a list of items to buy.` - She created a list of what she wanted to buy before going to the store.

We will likely be in the middle of creating these, or have them partially finished at certain points, and still want to show them as coming soon until they are completed. I'll have to check, but it should work already. 

If a block is upcoming it won't have challenges and so will be rendered as ""coming soon"". 

If it is not upcoming, it'll get rendered as normal. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0d8c0da-05e2-44f7-88a2-07acece186cb)

It could use some work, but now all the chapters, modules and blocks that appear in the superblock structure, but are empty will be rendered with the coming soon badge.

That means if you want a coming soon chapter, do this:

```json
    {
      ""dashedName"": ""name-of-new-chapter"",
      ""modules"": []
    }
 ```

If you want a coming soon module:

```
    {
      ""dashedName"": ""name-of-existing-chapter"",
      ""modules"": [
        {
          ""dashedName"": ""name-of-new-module"",
          ""blocks"": []
        }
      ]
    },
```

and finally, if you want a coming soon block, just leave `isUpcomingChange: true` in that block's `meta.json`. Well, I don't know how much I love it, but it seems to be working pretty decent @ojeytonwilliams.

With showUpcomingChanges = true, you see all the challenges as usual.
With showUpcomingChanges = false, the fsd superblock page doesn't build because there's no challenges - which I think is the current behavior. So you need to set `isUpcomingChange: false` in one of the `meta.json` files. Set it in the `lecture-introduction-to-javascript-libraries-and-framework` block to see the front end libraries chapter - which is the one with react and the upcoming modules. I see a few UI things that could be better - I'll clean some of them up on another PR",,"Checklist:

If a block doesn't exist yet, we can now create that block in the superblock [structure](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/curriculum/superblock-structure/full-stack.json) and it will render as a ""coming soon"" block on the superblock page.

For example, https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/ea15720fe34f134a54ee01c203ebd12426d4c41c/curriculum/superblock-structure/full-stack.json#L140-L146

would become

```json
          ""dashedName"": ""css-colors"",
          ""blocks"": [
            { ""dashedName"": ""lecture-working-with-colors-in-css"" },
            { ""dashedName"": ""workshop-colored-markers"" },
            { ""dashedName"": ""review-css-colors"" },
            { ""dashedName"": ""this-block-is-not-ready-yet"" },
            { ""dashedName"": ""quiz-css-colors"" }
          ]
```

and that module would look like this:

![new module ui](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e236264-8074-4b01-86d8-3a5d2caaf995)

It's also possible to create entire empty chapters or modules in the same way. E.g.

```json
    {
      ""dashedName"": ""coming-soon-chapter-1"",
      ""modules"": [
        {
          ""dashedName"": ""coming-soon-module-1"",
          ""blocks"": [{ ""dashedName"": ""coming-soon-block"" }]
        }
      ]
    }
```

and that will look like this

","doesn't this one need a coming soon too? It really doesn't matter that much. It will stay hidden until we change `isUpcomingChange: false` on that block. I think it's fine as-is. The more important thing here is that it easily allows it to add any items as coming soon when we need to. That's a good point. Also, if you want to show it as coming soon, it's a trivial change. Add the flag and update intro.json and it'll pop into being."

- `She has seen the report.` - At some point before now, she saw the report.
``` ```suggestion
Use this structure to talk about something that happened before now, but **where the exact time isn't important**.
``` ```suggestion
The past participle of the verb `see` is `seen`. It's irregular, which means it doesn't just add `-ed` like regular verbs. For example:
``` ```suggestion
To give a short answer, use `Yes` or `No`, followed by the subject (like `I`, `we`, or `they`) and then `have` or `haven't`. For example for the question `Have you seen the report?` you could use the short answers:
``` ```suggestion
- `No, I haven't.`
``` ```suggestion
James is not asking for Linda's opinion about the interface.

`Latest` means the most recent or newest. `User feedback` refers to the opinions, comments, or issues that users share about a product, service, or experience. 
``` ```suggestion

``` ```suggestion
The reports have not been reviewed on all devices.
```
I recall while talking about devices and platforms we use `on`. ```suggestion
The UI design is outdated on many devices.
``` ```suggestion
Auxiliary verb used to form questions in the `Present Perfect` tense. The first letter is capitalized.
```
There is no such tense as the Present Perfect Simple. ```suggestion
The `Present Perfect` tense is often used to ask about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past. 
``` ```suggestion
2
``` ```suggestion
- They haven't fixed this exact issue.
``` ```suggestion
Look for an option that doesn't contradict itself and provides a clear explanation, showing their experience with similar problems. 
``` ```suggestion
`Yes, I have. The navigation bar and the footer BLANK BLANK well to smaller screens.`
```
`adapting` is one of the answers. ```suggestion
When something `doesn't adapt well to smaller screens`, it means the content or layout doesn't display correctly, making it difficult for users to interact with the website.
``` ```suggestion
These two words refer to devices with small displays, like smartphones or tablets, where the elements are not displaying properly.
``` ```suggestion
- `Smaller screens` refers to devices like smartphones and tablets that have smaller displays. When something doesn't adapt well to smaller screens, it means it doesn't display correctly on these devices.
``` ```suggestion
Which detailed reports is James interested in?
```
We're not asking about possession, so `which` is better. ```suggestion
James is specifically asking about detailed reports related to the issue. Pay attention to the word `from` in the sentence, which indicates the source of the reports. 
``` ```suggestion
In this case, Linda needs to confirm if she has already received the reports. Consider the difference between these two responses:
``` ```suggestion
`On` is used to indicate the device where the overlapping occurs. It shows the relationship between the elements and the devices. For example:
``` ```suggestion
`The images overlap on the webpage, making it difficult to see all the content clearly.` - Here, `overlap` describes the positioning issue and `on` specifies where it occurs.
``` ```suggestion
`Our` refers to something that belongs to or involves the group, in this case, the team.

`Next step` refers to the following action or decision that needs to be taken.
``` ```suggestion
The auxiliary verb used to start a question in the `Present Perfect` tense for the third person singular. The first letter is capitalized.
``` ```suggestion
`Past participle` of the verb `to be`.
``` ```suggestion
- `Not yet.` - This answer indicates that the development team has not been informed, but the action may happen soon.

- `Yes, they have.` - This answer confirms that the development team has already been informed.
``` ```suggestion
The plural form of `fix`, this word refers to solutions or repairs for a problem. 
```
We're talking about noun here. ```suggestion
`Proposed` means something that has been suggested or put forward for consideration. For example:

 `The proposed plan includes a new timeline.` - It means that the plan, which includes a new timeline, has been suggested but not yet finalized or accepted.

Start by using the `export` keyword to create a `Card` functional component with `name`, `title`, and `bio` as the props. Don't forget to make sure they're all wrapped in a curly brace. That way, you destructure them instead of accessing them from `props`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `Card` component should have a `name`, `title`, and `bio` props.
``` This test doesn't work without the `export`, right? Maybe it's worth to remember that the component needs to be exported in this hint.

Your `p` element with `className` of `card-title` should have `{title}` as its text content.
``` This is not mentioned in the instructions ```suggestion
Inside the `App` component, return a pair of parenthesis containing an empty string.
``` ```suggestion
Inside your return statement, replace the empty string with a `div` element with a `className` property of `flex-container`.
``` ```suggestion
You should use the `Card` component as an element with a `name` prop set to `""Mark""`.
``` ```suggestion
You should use the `Card` component as an element with a `title` prop set to `""Frontend developer""`.

You should use the `Card` component as an element with a `bio` prop set to `""I like to work with different frontend technologies and play video games.""`.

Whether or not a challenge can be saved is not intrinsically related to `isProjectBased` which was originally intended to control how blocks are rendered.

The idea of this PR is to create a single source of truth for which type of challenges can be saved. In future we can consider decoupling ""savability"" from challenge type, but I think this is a step in the right direction.

I happens with my own solution and with yours as well.
For me, this test is usually taking a bit longer to execute, and it doesn't timeout every time. > I wonder if you changed those tests to actually fill out the form instead of overwriting the isValid function?

That was my initial attempt but for some reasons I wasn't able to make it work :face_with_diagonal_mouth: @moT01  > It behaves a little differently than the demo, but fulfills the user stories - it doesn't pass all the tests as they are. At the bottom, I add an event listener to the #form, and the dispatched events on the input elements in the tests won't cause that to fire

I don't like very much that once you fill a form field, the other fields become red, even if you haven't touched them yet.

But this is probably a bit too much for this lab, I agree. I updated the user stories as per your suggestions. Not sure what to do about the rest though @moT01  > I don't like very much that once you fill a form field, the other fields become red, even if you haven't touched them yet.

Yea, me neither - it does fulfill the user stories though. I think the suggestion to change the tests so the events bubble though, isn't specifically for that. I could still have a listener on the form and change the border colors based on the element changed instead of all of them. So if someone implements it like that, it will still pass for them. I don't think it hurts anything to add that, but I'm fine with leaving it as well. I modified the tests to use `{bubbles: true}`. Your solution passes now @moT01 

@zairahira told me that the issue was with the last test but @ilenia-magoni had issues with the last 3 tests. I decided to remove those 3 and the related user stories. I haven't found another solution. @Dario-DC,

I do not see any timeouts now üëçÔ∏èUnfortunately couldn't find anything to complain about @Dario-DC üòÖ Well, this really is a beast @Dario-DC - challenging and fun though üëç Here's what I found... 

I had a number of timeout errors on firefox as well. Sometimes they would go slow and timeout - other times they would all pass really fast. Also got a runtime error that says ""timeout"" at one point - so maybe not ideal. Didn't have any issues on chrome. I wonder if you changed those tests to actually fill out the form instead of overwriting the `isValid` function?

It behaves a little differently than the demo, but fulfills the user stories - it doesn't pass all the tests as they are. At the bottom, I add an event listener to the `#form`, and the dispatched events on the input elements in the tests won't cause that to fire. I changed all the tests to look like this: `field.dispatchEvent(new Event(""change"", { bubbles: true }));` to get them to trigger that event. We should add that to all those tests.

One thing you could maybe do to increase readability is group the first nine user stories into a list like some of the other labs have been doing. e.g:

```
1. When a form is submitted, you should:
 - ensure that `#full-name` is not empty.
 - ensure that #email is a valid email address format.
 - etc.
```

User stories 12 and 13 were a little confusing at first. Initially I thought that I should add a change listener, then I wondered if I was supposed to just change the colors on submit. Figured out that it was the change listener. Maybe we could reword those to something like:

```
If a change event is triggered on a form field and it has a valid value,
you should set its border color to green. In case of checkbox and radio
button groups, you should set the border color of the parent fieldset.
```

Here's the only one that fails for me:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4a2cef-ea2d-4792-a9f9-2117933942fb)
Not sure why it fails and why the others that failed for you are passing :thinking:  I took another small look at this. I found a couple of my tests weren't passing because of my browser zoom level. The `2px dashed red` border was calculated at `1.65px dashed red` or something - making some tests fail. That last test you mentioned, I couldn't quite figure out. It has to do with me calling the `swapElements` function only `if (!isOrdered(currentArr[i], currentArr[i+1]))`, but that array never gets generated because the generate button isn't clicked in the test. I added that, and it gave my an infinite loop. Maybe we should just remove that test for now? I feel like others might run into similar issues.
 Hey @moT01 , I was able to make that failing test work with your code by triggering a click event on `#generate-btn` but I was still getting ""potential infinite loop on line ..."" so I removed it as you suggested.

I slightly modified the CSS. Not sure if that is enough.

Should I change the tests that check that the border is `2px dashed red`?

Not strictly related to this: why don't we have the reset your code button anymore? If someone deletes something from the seed code and saves the changes it will be almost impossible to pass the lab then. > Not strictly related to this: why don't we have the reset your code button anymore?

this deserves an issue of its own, imho
With many of the projects having a lot of boilerplate code that is needed to make things work, having a `Reset Code` button seems important > I wasn't able to pass tests 15 and 20 with the provided solution.

I was a little confused with some of the things I needed to do, but was able to figure it out. I left a number of typo and grammar suggestions below to try and make some things a little more clear.

","```suggestion
The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts a sequence of integers by comparing couples of adjacent elements starting from the beginning of the sequence. If the first element is greater then the second one, it swaps them. Then, it proceeds with the following couple. When the sequence ends, it starts a new cycle from the beginning of the sequence, and repeats the process until the elements are sorted.
``` ```suggestion
1. You should have a function named `highlightCurrentEls` that takes an HTML element and a numeric index.
```

Typo here, along with all the other places this is used. There's quite a few. ```suggestion
Your `fillArrContainer()` function should fill the element passed to the function with five `span` elements with the text of an integer from the array passed to the function.
``` ```suggestion
1. The `fillArrContainer` function should fill the element passed to the function with five `span` elements with the text of an integer from the array passed to the function.
``` ```suggestion
1. The `highlightCurrentEls` function should set the `border` of the given element's child at the given index, and the child immediately after the index, to `2px dashed red`.
```

Tried to make this a little more clear. ```suggestion
1. When you click `#generate-btn` you should use your `generateArray` and `fillArrContainer` functions to fill `#starting-array-container` with the numbers from the array.
```

I had to look at the HTML to figure out how `#starting-array-container` and `#array-container` related to each other, and figure out where I needed to add elements when sorting. Wondering if renaming `#starting-array-container` to just `#starting-array` would help a bit. ```suggestion
1. You should have a function named `generateElement` that returns a random integer between `1` and `100`, inclusive.
``` ```suggestion
1. You should have a function named `generateArray` that uses the `generateElement` function to return an array containing five random integers.
``` ```suggestion
1. You should have a function named `generateContainer` that creates and returns an empty `div` element.
``` ```suggestion
1. Each `div` should contain five `span` elements, representing the array in its current state of being sorted.
``` or if they are equal, that could also be added. using `isOrdered` to check if two numbers need swapped goes wild if there isn't that check
the test fails if I do that tho, but if I don't my browser crashes with equal numbers 
```suggestion
After you click `#sort-btn`, each `div` within `#array-container` should contain five `span`, each with a number as its text, and arranged to represent the steps required by Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the starting array.
``` what happened to this file? This test is passing on initial seed code. 
```suggestion
    const container = document.querySelector(""#array-container"");
    assert.isNotEmpty(container.children);
```
maybe I removed duplicate placeholders and sorted the blocks ```suggestion

","```suggestion
When the loop reaches the letter `Z`, the sum `index + shift` exceeds the last index of the string `alphabet`. Therefore, `alphabet[new_index]` is trying to use an invalid index, which causes an `IndexError` to be thrown.

You can notice that the output in the terminal stops at the space immediately before the `Z`, the last `print` before the error is thrown.
``` We should not ask to comment out the function call. I would go with something like:

""Modify your function declaration so that it takes two parameters called `message` and `offset`. After that, you'll see an error appear in the terminal.""
 ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
Right now, your code raises a `TypeError`, because the `caesar` function is defined with two parameters (`message` and `offset`), therefore it expects to be called with two *arguments*.

Calling `caesar()` without the required arguments stops the execution of the code.
``` We might consider to get rid of those final tests that run the code and substitute them all, but I would focus on the instructions for now. ```suggestion
caesar()
``` ```suggestion
So, when no indented block is found after the final colon, the code execution stops and an `IndentationError` is thrown. This code will not show the output and instead raise an `IndentationError`:
``` I would add something to this step:

""When you try to change the individual characters of a string as you did in the previous step, you get a `TypeError`, which occurs when an object of inappropriate type is used in your code.

As you can see from the error message, strings do not support item assignment, because they are immutable. However, a variable can be reassigned another string:"" ```suggestion
Try to assign the string `'Hello Zaira'` to your `text` variable and see what happens in the terminal.

You'll see a `string index out of range` exception. Don't worry, you'll figure out how to fix it soon!

``` ```suggestion
Modify your function declaration so that it takes two parameters called message and offset.

After that, you'll see an error appear in the terminal. As a temporary fix, comment out the `caesar()` call.
``` I cannot leave the suggestion, but we need to expand the editable region to allow to comment out the function call. Considering the previous step, `caesar()` should be commented out in the seed. ```suggestion
Now, uncomment your `caesar()` call. You'll see that your code raises a `TypeError`, because the `caesar` function is defined with two parameters (`message` and `offset`), therefore it expects to be called with two *arguments*.
``` ```suggestion
When you try to change the individual characters of a string as you did in the previous step, you get a `TypeError`, which occurs when an object of inappropriate type is used in your code.
``` We have never mentioned what a traceback is. We should do it before this step or simply say ""error"" here. I agree, the cause of the error should be explained here instead of step 53.
In step 53, it can be mentioned that ""`Now you can see the error has disappeared as the required number of arguments have been passed`"". ```suggestion
You should comment out the `caesar()` function call.
``` ```suggestion

        ""title"": ""Build an nth Fibonacci number generator"",
```
I would wait for a native speaker to confirm that it sounds right in one way or another. ```suggestion
          ""For this lab, you will implement the nth Fibonacci number generator.""
``` ```suggestion
For this lab, you will implement the nth Fibonacci number generator.
``` ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion

In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered collection of numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integer numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

Here are the first ten numbers from the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

```
I would move part of a user story here as description.
 ```suggestion
1. A call to `fibonacci(n)` should use a dynamic programming approach to compute and return the `n`-th number from the Fibonacci sequence.
```
Following the previous comment ```suggestion
1. If the input is not a positive integer, the function should return `""Invalid input""`.
``` then there is alto to add an en-dash after `nth`, nth‚ÄìFibonacci number, maybe? ```suggestion
1. A call to `fibonacci(n)` should use a dynamic programming approach to compute and return the `n`-th number from the Fibonacci sequence.
```
In my opinion we should keep this as a user story and modify the description in some way. ""The function should compute numbers in the Fibonacci sequence as needed"" is a bit cryptic and we need to specify what the function should return. ```suggestion
1. If the input number requests an already computed number, no new computations should happen and the number should be retrieved from the `sequence` array.
``` The code also checks if the type is not of type number, this should be described in the user story. Zero is not a positive nor a negative number. We should remove this or use a different input to test. How can two different values have the same output? This doesn't make sense. Sequence should be part of the function. If you call `fibonacci(5)`, then when you call `fibonacci(3)` the values of the sequence should have been already computed up to the fifth element. The idea is to have it outside the function and look at what has been already computed before.
If you call `fibonacci(n)`, then when you want to know the `m`-th element in the sequence you should get it directly from `sequence` if `m <= n` instead of computing it again. I see, that's still a little confusing. Could we add an example for this? I was about to say the same, but the user story is accurate because it says ""If the input is not a positive integer"" so everything else is excluded. So I think this can be kept as is.
One thing that I would clarify is that tests are checking that the type is not different from ""number"". Where would you add the example? Before user stories? I would put it after, as it is the last story. I sort of agree with you. While in fact it states ""if the input is not a positive integer."". We should make clear to the camper that the input could be of any kind.

This will otherwise cause too many issues on the forum. if the camper compute the Fibonacci sequence as requested, outside the function, it doesn't need an example. This is checking that if the number already exist in the sequence, then no new numbers are added to the sequence. I would guess trying to explain this more would cause more confusion I can remove the string test, but I see no reason to remove the 0 Okay, I will resolve this one. Let me reiterate, I think it's fine, but the user has too little context to go on. Most of the time when completing coding challenges the user is expected to exclude any negative number (If the user story is phrased like this).

 We could write an extra hint that checks invalid values?

Like: The fibonacci function should not accept `3.5` as a valid input.

and: The fibonacci function should not accept `0` as a valid input. divide it into multiple tests? shure It should be mentioned in the instruction to check for other invalid inputs like a string as there is a test present for it,

```suggestion
1. If the input is a string or not a positive integer, the function should return `""Invalid input""`.
``` I think it's fine to keep it as is: the test has been split and one can clearly see that a string is not accepted as argument. Modifying the sentence in this way can cause more confusion than benefits in my opinion."

The only issue I have is that the second test passes even when there's no code.  A PR has been merged that renamed the certification from ""Front End"" to ""Full Stack"". This PR may need an update and a few changes made: [see comment](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56694#issuecomment-2444473378) A PR has been merged that [moves the block order from the `meta.json` file to the `full-stack.json` file.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56795) This PR will need an update, and the order will need to be removed from the `meta.json` file and moved to the new file. @ihechikara 

I am currently testing your lab now locally. But I noticed that the lab was in the incorrect module. So I pushed up a commit to resolve that @jdwilkin4 @zairahira this is almost ready for review. I've used the user stories and tests suggested by Jessica. All the tests work at the moment, but I still have to test for:

- Allowing the use of both template literals and string concatenation when logging out `password`.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know so I can implement them before it's ready for review. @ihechikara, here is a similar test from the sentence maker lab:

````md
You should log your second story using the format `""Second story: [secondStory]""`.

```js
const condition1 = /console\.log\(\s*[""']Second\s+story:\s+[""']\s*\+\s*secondStory\s*\);?/gm.test(code);
const condition2 = /console\.log\(\s*`Second\s+story:\s+\$\{secondStory\}`\s*\);?/gm.test(code);
assert.isTrue(condition1 || condition2);
```
````

Let me know if this works. > @ihechikara, here is a similar test from the sentence maker lab:

Thanks @zairahira. That worked!

 I have left a couple of comments. Build is impossible like this. I was able to play around with this locally and I think it is off to a good start but it is still to strict IMO.

Right now, we are testing for things, that we shouldn't care about like if they use the `let` keyword to create a variable named `chars`. Or that they use a `for` loop when any type of loop is acceptable. 

Here is my suggestion for the revised user stories that allows for more open ended solutions:

````md
**User Stories:**

1. You should create a function called `generatePassword` that takes a parameter. You can name the parameter whatever you like. 
2. Your function should return a string which represents a randomly generated password. You should use the following string and different `Math` methods to help you return a new string with random characters in it. 

```js
""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()""
```

3. You should have a variable called `strLen` and assign it the result of prompting the user with the following message: `""Enter the desired length for the password:""`. Since the `prompt` method returns a string, make sure to convert that result to a number.
4. You should have a variable called `password` and assign it the result of calling the `generatePassword` function with the argument of `length`. 
5. You should have a `console.log` that logs the message `""Generated password:""` followed by the `password` variable. 
````

Also, I don't think we need a `runPasswordGenerator` function.
We could just have something like this for the final solution

```
const strLen = parseInt(prompt(""Enter the desired length for the password:""), 10);
const password = generatePassword(strLen);
console.log(`Generated password: ${password}`);
```
As for the tests, the revised user stories should make it easier to test.
Here were the hints that I came up with

````md
You should have a `generatePassword` function with a parameter. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
Your `generatePassword` function should return a string.
Your `generatePassword` function should return a new string that is the correct length.
Your function should return a randomly generated password with valid characters.
Your function should return a new random string each time it is called.
You should have a variable called `strLen`.
You should prompt the user for the password length.
Your `strLen` variable should be a number.
You should have a `password` variable.
Your `password` variable should be a string.
You should log the generated password to the console.
````

You don't need to take my suggestions exactly for the user stories or hints, but I do think this lab should be refactored a little bit to be more open ended and better match the other labs currently in the curriculum.   I went through the lab, and here are some suggestions:

1. I feel the user stories can be made a bit more generic. We shouldn't tell explicitly if a variable should be declared via `let` or `const`. Also, campers should be allowed to use both- arrow and regular funcitons. 
I have modified the instructions, feel free to include them if they look right to you:

<details>
  <summary>User Stories</summary>

```md  
1. You should create an function named `generatePassword` that takes `length` as a parameter.
2. Within the `generatePassword` function, create a variable named `chars` that should have a value of all possible characters that can be included in the password. You can use `""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()""`.
3. Within the `generatePassword` function, you should create a variable named `password` that should be initially an empty string.
4. Within the `generatePassword` function, you should create a `for` loop that runs `length` times. In the body of the loop:
    - Generate a random index between `0` upto the length of `chars` and store it in a variable named `randomIndex`
    - Append the random characters to `password`.
5. The `generatePassword` function should return the `password`.
6. You should create a function named `runPasswordGenerator`.
7. Within `runPasswordGenerator`, prompt the user with the message `Enter the desired length for the password:`. Store the user input in a variable and don't forget to convert the stored length to an integer.
8. Within `runPasswordGenerator`, call the `generatePassword` function with the provided length as a parameter and store the returned password in a variable.
9. Within `runPasswordGenerator`, you should log the generated password to the console using the message `Generated password: ${password}`.
10. Finally, you should call the `runPasswordGenerator` function and see the result.
```

</details>

2. `length` and `password` have been used repetitively across the code. It seems fine, but might confuse the campers.

3. Hints can be extended:
- The `chars` variable should not be empty.
- `generatePassword(5)` should return a password with the `length` of `5`.

4. It would be good to add a minimum limit of characters to `chars`:
- `chars` should be at least 10 characters long. LGTM üéâ 

Note - to test this PR at the moment, you either need to change the challengeType back to 14 or add the changes from https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/57507. We are fine to merge it as-is.","Left some comments but also it looks like one of the tests is failing here

","if `assert.lengthOf` works for a function you could use that here I added it to a project I worked on, I can confirm it works for functions, so you can use that!

I did not find a solution for this. Without checking that those elements are placed in a specific position, I don't know how to be sure that the house will actually look like a house. I think we should either go back to something similar to the previous lab (where the result should be exactly as the demo) or accept that it might not look like a house.
 I would vote to accept that it might not look like a house. If you want, you could add some more specifics to test for a few of the items. Like force the doors and windows to be in a certain position so you can test it - and leave the rest up to the user - but I would be fine with it if the solutions don't end up looking like a house. I added a few additional tests and user stories to have a result much similar to a house.You are missing some optional chaining, `getStyle` returns `null` if the selector doesn't exist, optional chaining is needed. I don't think I got them all either.

some suggestions to improve helpers usage
~~If you don't use the value, looking at the helpers docs, there is `.isPropertyUsed`, it returns a boolean.~~ it seems to be for the whole stylesheet instead of a single rule, so not useful here
Also, there is `getStyleAny` that you can use for multiple selectors.
For a list of possible selectors for an element there is `selectorsFromSelector`

``` @ilenia-magoni, the issue with these formats is how the browser handles/converts different CSS rules. For example:

```js
assert.match(

  /^rgb\s*\(\s*\d+\s*,\s*\d+\s*,\s*\d+\s*\)$/
);
```

The test above will pass for both rgb and hsl. The tests you suggested for `.color1` and `.color4` don't work, but with a little workaround, `.color1` starts passing for hex, rgb, and hsl values.

IMO, using regex here ensures each test passes for specific rules. I couldn't find a workaround before switching to regex.

CC @moT01 @jdwilkin4  alright
you should use then `__helpers.removeCssComments()` to remove comments from the code before regex testing This is only checking if there is a value for the background-color not which value it is, at least this one is fine ```suggestion

Hey @naomi-lgbt , these are great points. I'll answer one by one. 

Lists: We opted to use lists mainly to separate examples, an idea inspired by some adjustments you made to the A2 curriculum last year. Could you share any alternative suggestions you have on organizing these examples without lists?

Tense Formatting: The team agreed on a standard where tenses are in backticks with the first letter capitalized. For example: `Present Perfect`. If you spot any inconsistencies, please feel free to suggest changes. Also, I'm compiling a [guideline document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-_72GpPqifdbpUqsE-RxCs7nKmHlqpr0C-XRydOXJe4/edit?tab=t.0), to streamline these details, and I‚Äôll make sure to include this instruction on tense formatting for reference.

Dialogue in Inline Code: I completely agree with you that a single code block would be ideal. Currently, we‚Äôre wrapping lines individually to avoid awkward line breaks. I‚Äôve asked Oliver to explore potential solutions for this. If you have any ideas on achieving a clean, single-block format without compromising line breaks or translation in Crowdin (These dialogues shouldn't be translated), we‚Äôd love to hear them. This is a priority for the EC right now. > Could you share any alternative suggestions you have on organizing these examples without lists?

We definitely don't want to use lists to call out something that isn't actually a list. Some alternatives to consider:

- Wrap the example in a multi-line code block instead of an inline code block
- Put the example sentence in a block quote
- Create a custom component to call it out the way we want (this is the hard option)

> Currently, we‚Äôre wrapping lines individually to avoid awkward line breaks

We also shouldn't be doing this. If we need to change how the text wraps or scrolls, we should do so via CSS changes, not through forcing syntax that doesn't fit. Thank you @naomi-lgbt @nieldakarla for reviewing these tasks, especially adjusting the audio time. I'm checking and applying your suggestions. I'll let you know when I finish it. > About the large chunks of text: Naomi made a very nice suggestion on a review task. In this kind of task, the dialogue is inside the header ## --sentence--, so the formatting looks polished. I recommend you have a look, accept her changes and apply to the other review tasks.

@nieldakarla @naomi-lgbt I accepted Naomi's change suggestions, and then it reported an error when I ran the curriculum locally to do further review. Maybe some code should be updated.

Anyway, I feel it looks nice when I change it back to the original: 

![review](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46fcddab-223b-4557-acbb-e29b23da5d9d)
 Hi @naomi-lgbt @nieldakarla I've made changes based on all your suggestions. One thing I need help: the dialogue-4 task is out of order because I insert several tasks before it. Could you help fix it? Thanks. What task numbers should it be between? > We definitely don't want to use lists to call out something that isn't actually a list. Some alternatives to consider:

We decided to use lists only if there's more than one example. If it's just one we decided to remove the dash, just like you suggested.

Talked to Tom, he said we could keep them as they are now, and try to find a solution after, as it seems to be trickier. 

Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions, @naomi-lgbt. :)

Okay, thanks for catching the errors:)Okay, I haven't gone through all of the content yet, but there's some things that glaringly stand out.

- We should not be using single list items for styling in the explanations. While it may look good to a sighted user, a screen reader is going to announce it as a list when it really isn't.
- We seem to be inconsistent with how we refer to the tense. Sometimes it's `` `Present Perfect` `` in code tags, sometimes it's lowercased `present perfect` without code tags, and everything in between. We should choose one style (IMHO, lower case without code tags) and use it consistently.
- The large walls of dialogue should not be individually wrapped in inline code. Making them a full code block is a better UX. Hello @miyaliu666 this block looks great. üéâ Thank you so much for all your effort.

I've ran locally your PR and reviewed all the tasks one by one. Here are a couple of things to consider:

**Formatting standards:**
 - As Naomi pointed out, some time tenses are not inside backticks.  I've tried to correct the ones I caught but I recommend you reviewing this as well. 
 - Some tasks are using `For example,` whereas it should be  `For example:` I noticed this on tasks: 3, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 22, 24, 33, 34, 36, 37, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 73,  75, 77, 80, 82, 86, 87, 95, 98, 101, 103, 106, 108, 113 and 110.
 - Naomi pointed out that using a list for examples with just one item is not good for accessibility.  I apologize for the trouble. I'm going to ask you to remove the `-` in front of lists with just one example. I believe we can keep them for lists with 2 items or more. I'll be doing the same with my other blocks. 
 - About the large chunks of text: Naomi made a very nice suggestion on a `review task`. In this kind of task, the dialogue is inside the header ## --sentence--, so the formatting looks polished. I recommend you have a look, accept her changes and apply to the other review tasks. 
 Unfortunately, this solution doesn't work for the `reading tasks` so we haven't find a definite solution for this case yet. I'm waiting to see if Naomi has got a suggestion.
 For now, I think we can keep using the backticks as we agreed on the guidelines document. 
 - Blanks with too many words: We should be careful when creating blanks with too many words, as this can overwhelm students and force them to stay too long in one single task. I've left several comments on instances where I considered the blanks too long. I'd appreciate if you could have a look on them. 

**Animation adjustments:**

- Some animations had CCs with too much text which doesn't work well on smaller screens. I've made the adjustments, and for those where the same animation is used in multiple tasks I've left a comment asking you to apply the change to the following tasks.

**New tasks requests:**

There are some tasks that I feel the audio is simply too long. Some I just broke the CC into different lines, but for others, specially for dialogue 4, I believe there should be individual tasks for each sentence. I've left comments for each case. 

I know this is a long msg but I think this is the best way we can fine tune our task creation process. Please, feel free to reach out in case any comment I've left wasn't clear enough.   Miya, this looks great! Congratulations and thank you for all you effort. i've left two suggestions, you can easily merge here. Besides that, it looks good to me. =)","Okay, I haven't gone through all of the content yet, but there's some things that glaringly stand out.

- We should not be using single list items for styling in the explanations. While it may look good to a sighted user, a screen reader is going to announce it as a list when it really isn't.
- We seem to be inconsistent with how we refer to the tense. Sometimes it's `` `Present Perfect` `` in code tags, sometimes it's lowercased `present perfect` without code tags, and everything in between. We should choose one style (IMHO, lower case without code tags) and use it consistently.
- The large walls of dialogue should not be individually wrapped in inline code. Making them a full code block is a better UX. Hello @miyaliu666 this block looks great. üéâ Thank you so much for all your effort.

I've ran locally your PR and reviewed all the tasks one by one. Here are a couple of things to consider:

**Formatting standards:**
 - As Naomi pointed out, some time tenses are not inside backticks.  I've tried to correct the ones I caught but I recommend you reviewing this as well. 
 - Some tasks are using `For example,` whereas it should be  `For example:` I noticed this on tasks: 3, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 22, 24, 33, 34, 36, 37, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 73,  75, 77, 80, 82, 86, 87, 95, 98, 101, 103, 106, 108, 113 and 110.
 - Naomi pointed out that using a list for examples with just one item is not good for accessibility.  I apologize for the trouble. I'm going to ask you to remove the `-` in front of lists with just one example. I believe we can keep them for lists with 2 items or more. I'll be doing the same with my other blocks. 
 - About the large chunks of text: Naomi made a very nice suggestion on a `review task`. In this kind of task, the dialogue is inside the header ## --sentence--, so the formatting looks polished. I recommend you have a look, accept her changes and apply to the other review tasks. 
 Unfortunately, this solution doesn't work for the `reading tasks` so we haven't find a definite solution for this case yet. I'm waiting to see if Naomi has got a suggestion.
 For now, I think we can keep using the backticks as we agreed on the guidelines document. 
 - Blanks with too many words: We should be careful when creating blanks with too many words, as this can overwhelm students and force them to stay too long in one single task. I've left several comments on instances where I considered the blanks too long. I'd appreciate if you could have a look on them. 

**Animation adjustments:**

- Some animations had CCs with too much text which doesn't work well on smaller screens. I've made the adjustments, and for those where the same animation is used in multiple tasks I've left a comment asking you to apply the change to the following tasks. 
- I've also made some minor adjustments to several timestamps to prevent them from cutting words. All the changes I've made were tested on my computer locally, feel free to test them and see if they still work.

I made some other minor tweaks (status code, test descriptions). The big thing I didn't change was the response - it's still text (not json) so that the client will fail to parse it, throw an error and show the error response.

Prior to this PR, the inline script (see below) was transformed twice. Once by the transformation pipeline and again by the babel script we embed in the preview. The second transform, as well as being unnecessary, generates a warning:

```
You are using the in-browser Babel transformer. Be sure to precompile your scripts for production - https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/
```

and this PR skips it and stops the warning from appearing.

As an example we use inline React like this:

```html
    <script
        data-plugins=""transform-modules-umd""
        type=""text/babel""
        data-presets=""react""
        data-type=""module""

        import { MoodBoard } from './index.jsx';
        ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
            <MoodBoard />
        );
    </script>

I have modified the tests to not use `poll.clear()` every time. Maybe this was interfering/overriding your solutions.

I have also added the following tests/user stories:

- You should have at least three options in your `poll`.
- Your `poll` should have at least three votes.

Let me know if this is good to go. The new tests now prevent the modification of user's poll entries.

Here is the user's poll data:

```js
// add 3 options 

addOption(""Miami"");
addOption(""New York"");
addOption(""DC"");

// vote for the options

vote(""Miami"", ""traveler1"");
vote(""New York"", ""traveler2"");
vote(""DC"", ""traveler3"");


```

These are the results after running the tests:

One other thing you could add is some user stories and tests like I mentioned on the bank account lab to have users add to their poll and make votes. e.g.

""You should have at least three options in your poll.""
""Your poll should have at least three votes.""

Not necessary to add that, but I think it makes it better. I still see the outcome of the last test in the console. Ideally, you should save a copy of the map, make your changes to test things, and then restore the map to how it was before the test.

Something like this:

```js
const pollCopy = new Map(poll);
try {
  poll.clear();
  // modify poll as needed
  // assert things
} finally {
  // the finally block is required for when the assert fails
  // otherwise you won't restore the map
  poll.clear();
  pollCopy.forEach((val, key) => {

   - If you try to add an empty option, the function should return the message `Option cannot be empty.`.
```
I would remove them because quotes are part of the string in other cases in which are used  I wasn't able to figure out how to pass this because from the example seemed that `Option` should have been part of the final string. For example `Option Morocco: 25 votes` instead of `Morocco: 25 votes` Is this better:

````md
```js
Poll Results:
OptionA: N votes

This PR fixes search for Portuguese builds, enables Ukrainian search hits and redirects to the Ukrainian search page, and adds a note about a couple of locales we no longer build News for.","I only vaguely remember how to configure the search, but do these values need to match with the `algoliaIndices` values in the /news repo here? https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news/blob/main/config/index.js Hi @sidemt, thanks for taking a look at this. Sorry, just seeing your comment now.

Yes, the index names should match what we have over on News. In this case the Portuguese index name on Algolia is `news-pt-br`, and is set correctly on News, but not on Learn.

There are some exceptions like German where we build Learn in German but not News, and in those cases it's best to show English search results because there are no articles to link to and no search page. ```suggestion
    searchPage: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/'
```
There's no swahili news at the moment. @scissorsneedfoodtoo Thank you for clarifying! I somehow misread your diff at first and thought the index names for Portuguese didn't match, but the change was the other way around. So the values for Portuguese LGTM. üëç 

As Oliver mentioned, the Swahili URL needs to be updated to point to English news. Thanks for catching that, @ojeytonwilliams. Totally missed that ü§¶ "

```suggestion

        ""title"": ""Reusable Mega Navbar"",
        ""intro"": [""In the previous lecture videos, you learned how to work with components in React."", ""In this workshop, you will build a reusable Navbar component using React.""]
``` ```suggestion
In this workshop, you will practice working with React functional components by building a resuable navbar. 

All the CSS have been provided for you so you can focus on creating the navbar.
``` You should add a sentence explaining why the component name needs to start with a capital letter as a way to differentiate from regular HTML elements. 

You should also explain why we need to export this. Campers will have learned the basics of imports and exports but it will still be good to explain why they have to do this ```suggestion
Start by defining a `Navbar` functional component that returns a set of curly braces. In the next step, you will start to build out the component using JSX. 

Make sure to `export` the component, as it will be imported into the HTML file.

Also, React functional components need to start with a capital letter because it is a way to differentiate from regular HTML elements. 
``` ```suggestion
You should use the `export` keyword to export the `Navbar` component.
``` ```suggestion
Your `Navbar` function should return a pair of curly braces. 
``` we should provide context so they better understand what is going on here. Also, you should connect back to the lectures whenever possible since everything is connected. 

Also, all instances of `className` should be in backticks.

````suggestion
Now it is time to build out the `Navbar` component using JSX. 

You learned in the previous lecture videos that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and manage React components.

Here is a remainder of what JSX looks like:

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>freeCodeCamp React Curriculum</h1>
      <p>I love learning with freeCodeCamp!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Inside the `return`, create a `nav` element with a `className` called `navbar`. The reason why `className` is used here instead of `class` is because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. So, React uses `className` as a way to apply classes to elements. 
```` missing backticks 

```suggestion
You should create a `nav` element.
``` missing backticks 

```suggestion
Your `nav` element should have the `className` `navbar`.
``` assert.equal should work here the lengthOf assert should work here and would be specific then the generic assert missing backticks 

```suggestion
Give all three `li` elements the `className` `nav-item`.
``` ```suggestion
Your three `li` elements should have the `className` `nav-item`.
``` we should specific assert methods when possible.

assert.strictEqual should work here same here.

for consistency and matching with the documentation, we should use specific assert methods where possible.

for the first one, lengthOf should work and for the other two assert.strictEqual should work  same here

it looks like assert.lengthOf should work for the first one,  assert.strictEqual should work for the others. And for the one about `haspopup`, `isTrue` could possible work here same here

it looks like assert.strictEqual should work here lengthOf should work here should be `className`. Also spelling error

```suggestion
Create three new list items inside your `ul` element with the `className` `sub-menu`.
```

 same here.
we should always use specific assert methods where possible. assert.strictEqual should work here same here.
we should always use specific assert methods where possible. assert.strictEqual should work here ```suggestion
Inside the third list item, create a button and add the `aria-expanded` attribute set to `false`. Also, set the text of the `button` to `Apps`.

The `aria-expanded` attribute will communicate to screen reader users that the button triggers an expandable submenu.
```

It's `aria-haspopup`, but you would only use that with a true ARIA menu, which this is not. This is a simple navigation menu that does not need the enhanced ARIA attributes. A simple `aria-expanded` is all that is needed here to tell screen reader users that the item has a submenu. Also, you would use a button as the toggle element, not a link. The general rule is that links take you places and buttons do things. In this case, the purpose of this element is to hide/show the submenu. So it is doing something.

I'll let someone else make the necessary updates to the tests and other steps. ```suggestion
Still inside the third `li` element, create a `ul` element for the popup. Give it a `className` of `sub-menu`.
```

This list doesn't need to be named. It will be clear to screen reader users that it is the submenu for Apps because it follows the Apps button directly in the DOM. But if you really want to name it, it would not be ""submenu"". It would just be the name of the button, ""Apps"". Screen reader users will then hear ""Apps list"" when they navigate to it. That's really all they need.

Again, I'll let someone else make the necessary updates to the tests and other steps. this should be `className` not `class`.
you will need to update this in all instances where this occurs ```suggestion
To finish things up, set a text of `Calendar` for the first anchor tag, `Chat` for the second, and `Email` for the third one.
``` ```suggestion
You should set a text of `Calendar` for the first anchor element.
``` ```suggestion
assert(document.querySelectorAll('li a')[3]?.textContent === 'Calendar');

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
The 3 asserts in this step were all changed as follows:
- the first one was changed to allow single or double outer quotes and single or double inner quotes. 
- the second one was simplified to not repeat the full regex pattern that was in the first and instead to focus on checking the length property is there and is not followed by any other character (like parenthesis). The check optionally allows the presence of semicolon at the end of the line.
- the third check was changed to allow single or double outer quotes and single or double inner quotes plus the length property check was enforced (to not allow any character after the property - like parenthesis - but spaces and/or a final semicolon are accepted)

I'll take a look at those failures now. @naomi-lgbt I've cleared out a little of the repetition and the tests should pass now.

It's a little awkward since they're testing `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES===false` and `useFeature('fcc-10').on === true`, i.e.  what we would deploy, were we to turn on the growthbook flag, not what we actually deploy.

``` the slash is already included in `forumTopicUrl`, it can cuase confusion I had this failing because I was using `round` instead of `floor`, it's difficult to see why it's failing I added two tests. Let me know if it can work like that This works to check if someone is using `ceil` probably. To check `round` vs `floor` it probably need 115 minutes that should give 1h
 this also to check for round vs floor it would need to be like 40 hours should give 1 day.

This test would still pass doing `Math.round(25 / 24)` which gives `1`

Instead there is a difference between `Math.floor(40 / 24)` and `Math.round(40 / 24)`

The extra abstraction makes the `onClick` a tiny bit cleaner, but it doesn't feel worth it. Also the theme logic needs to be updated here:
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/d5f109ac4e5fbc3c90ca61657dd2a820d155720b/client/src/components/layouts/default.tsx#L177

After that,  all of the interfaces and components that consume theme should be double checked. 
They should work properly, but just in case. 
 >     2. only create the dispatch functions (i.e. the ones typically called `toggleNightMode`) where they're used. Everything is wrapped by the Redux provider, so there's no need to pass the functions around as props.

I'm a little bit confused about this and my lack of Redux expertise is showing unfortunately. I'm certain I'm doing things wrong here, but don't know how to fix it. 
 Yes, all of the scenarios as outlined here:
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/55981#issuecomment-2352279486 Hold on. Just so I don't do something kinda silly, I can remove the saga for setting the theme and have the local storage key set like in any regular React component?  > remove the saga for setting the theme and have the local storage key set like in any regular React component

I'm not quite sure what you have in mind, but it sounds like we'd have to duplicate the code for handling theme updates which doesn't sound ideal. My plan was to disconnect the theme from the database and have the browser be the central authority on the theme. Though that's a really good point about the need to rewrite the code several times.  I've re-based it to get rid of the merge conflict. Basically my plan is to remove the API calls and database. 

Edit: Day late but I figured out it needed the API calls. That's what displays the flash messages.  @ojeytonwilliams, just double checking. There should not be a need to alter anything in the api in pr, correct? > There should not be a need to alter anything in the api in pr, correct?

That's right. For this PR we just want the client to stop making use of the theme that the api returns. I undid that last commit. I got a little eager there.  That's okay. It's a limitation of our current platform, but it's best to assume that any changes to the api have to be compatible with both the currently deployed client and the next one. Same deal with client changes.

That means it's perfectly fine to, say, add a new endpoint to the api, since the client won't use it. In contrast, removing an endpoint that the client is using isn't safe, even if the same commit changes the client such that it doesn't use it.

I'm simplifying the constraints slightly, but the extra complexity are implementation details and the current mental model should be good for some time. Let me know when you are done with updates so I could take another look. I don't wanna point this out, but by changing the theme names, Prism is trying to load the wrong files. That's actually kinda unexpected. I had no idea the two were linked like that. 

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/87cea98d522e1d0446b14505c340a1d65b0a6f14/client/src/components/SolutionViewer/solution-viewer.tsx

```  The theme on the db and api stays the same.  The theme is saved as 'light' and 'dark' in the localStorage. Let me know if that makes sense.
 I'm confused. Why am I getting the error and crashing?  > I'm confused. Why am I getting the error and crashing?

Prism doesn't have a ""light"" theme, so trying to import one (i.e. specifying it in the babel config) will not work.

I'm not sure if Prism can be configured to map from ""light"" to ""default"", but if not we will have to keep using ""default"" whenever we interact with it. That or create a new theme - if Prism allows that. Regardless, all of this feels out of scope. This PR should make it possible to use local storage instead of the db. That's sufficient.

Finally, to reiterate, we can't modify the api and client at the same time, so any api changes should come in a followup PR. >  The theme is saved as 'light' and 'dark' in the localStorage. Let me know if that makes sense.

Is the change to ""light"" necessary for news, @ahmaxed? If not, I think we should stick to ""default"" so we avoid the headache of getting Prism to understand what ""light"" means.  > Finally, to reiterate, we can't modify the api and client at the same time, so any api changes should come in a followup PR.

I apologize but I was concerned that if I had renamed ""default"" to ""light"" , the theme toggle switch would no longer function correctly as the validation would not allow ""light"" or ""dark"" to be used.  Yep, I understand. The thing is, the value in the db will become irrelevant, so all we will need to do is delete/deprecate all the theme specific logic and endpoint(s).

That is, at some point later, when we clean up. I worked on the changes locally and was able to resolve the prism error. Will be removing the last commit and pushing soon. Excuse me, Ahmed. I have a merge conflict. This is the part where I might rebase to resolve it, but given what you have been helping me on; that would be detrimental.

What do you suggest I do?  I will take care of the conflict. 
 This should do it.
We might need to update the notes in the settings page to include the notification for removing the theme toggle in favor of the nav one.
Also, we might need to extend the tests to make sure the localStorage value is prioritized. @a2937, let me know if you need help with the tests.
 I'm a little confused by something. The `setTheme` function in the editor tests returns a status of 500 locally. I'm fairly sure the same is happening in our continuous integration tests? 

I'm going to change the values being passed into the `setTheme` function in the test and see if that changes anything. If it doesn't, I might need a little more guidance. 

Edit: I think I know what's happening now. The System color theme is not being used.  Hi @a2937, thanks for taking this on. 

I think there's a more robust approach, since theme switching is triggered by dispatching Redux actions. Every time the `updateMyTheme` action is dispatched, the `updateMyThemeSaga` will be processed. That means we can handle any side effects (like updating local storage) in that saga.

Also, if you've got time, there are a couple of refactors that would really benefit the theme code:

1. rename `toggleNightMode` to `updateMyTheme`. We use both more or less interchangeably and it's rather confusing.
2. only create the dispatch functions (i.e. the ones typically called `toggleNightMode`) where they're used. Everything is wrapped by the Redux provider, so there's no need to pass the functions around as props.

Only if you've got time, of course! Sorry, @a2937, I shouldn't have asked for that refactor: it was a little premature.

As I understand it, the goal is to use `localStorage` as the single source of truth for the `theme` for both freecodecamp.org and freecodecamp.org/news. For that to happen, we can't also be using the value in the db. As such, this PR should also remove any reliance on the `user.theme` value and stop making requests to the api to change the theme.

The logic, then would be:

if the theme is in localstorage, use that value, otherwise use the system's default. 

Before we do anything else, @ahmaxed is that accurate? 

 All good from mobile app perspective I only have a couple of nitpicks, so I'm approving. Thanks for your patience, @a2937 ","Hi @a2937, thanks for taking this on.

I think I managed to make it so that the default theme is retrieved from local storage and it gets set properly. But I don't think the key is named quite right. ","```suggestion
    localStorage.setItem('theme', update.theme);
```
The message coming back from the api does not include the theme. ```suggestion
```

The theme on the certification page is always default. ```suggestion
            defaultTheme={Themes.Default}
``` redoing the change as explained above. it looks like updateMyTheme/toggleNightMode is not being used at all in this component. There is no need to access the theme, pass it through components, invert it, and pass it to updateMyTheme.
updateMyTheme can access the theme directly, invert it and reset it.
Calling the action toggleTheme would be the most appropriate. I suggest making a function called getThemeClass and move all of the related logic inside.
This also needs to set the Theme to localStorage if not found in localStronge.
  
Also the theme names need to be standardized to 'light' and 'dark' when they are saved.
That will help us carry the same naming convention from the ui component library and our variables to the theme value storage.  Should I proceed to rename the actions and the name of the saga?  I have a new issue. Unfortunately for me, the theme toggle is behaving very oddly. It isn't updating automatically any more.  ```suggestion
          aria-pressed={theme === LocalStorageThemes.Dark}
```
Since we're here! Which order matters? ```suggestion
  const selectTheme =
    isLocalStorageThemeDark || isUserThemeDark || isSysThemeDark
      ? 'dark'
      : 'light';
``` ```suggestion
```
A ternary is nicer, imo. Is the idea that we're using the db theme initially, so we don't overwrite people's settings? If so, a comment explaining that this is a temporary measure could be useful. Yes, once the local storage key is set db theme is ignored. I will expand the comment below. the order of the logical expression. I will expand the comments to cover that.  Sorry, Ahmad, I didn't ask the right question.

If order matters, we can't use `isLocalStorageThemeDark || isUserThemeDark || isSysThemeDark` because that's true if _any_ of the three are true and false otherwise. It doesn't encode the precedence.

Thing is, what exactly _is_ the precedence? If the localStorage has a theme, use it. Otherwise if there's a userTheme, use it. Otherwise default to system?

If that's the case this needs to do things like

```
const hasLocalStorageTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') !== null;
if (hasLocalStorageTheme) return localStorage.getItem('theme') === 'dark' ? 'dark' : 'light'
// and the same for the other two.
```
 That makes sense. Here is my proposed solution:

```js
  const userTheme = yield select(userThemeSelector);
  const localStorageTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
  const isSysThemeDark = window.matchMedia(
    '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'
  ).matches;

  let selectTheme = 'light';

  if (localStorageTheme !== null) {
    selectTheme = localStorageTheme == 'dark' ? 'dark' : 'light';
  } else if (userTheme !== null) {
    selectTheme = userTheme == 'night' ? 'dark' : 'light';
  } else if (isSysThemeDark) {
    selectTheme = 'dark';
  }

  localStorage.setItem('theme', selectTheme);
  yield put(setTheme(selectTheme));
  
 ```
 Can I implement it, since this is still technically my PR and all?  Absolutely, @a2937. Thanks! Okay I should look at how the tests do things to make sure nothing was missed because everything looked fine on paper.  At minimum, I can confirm that the localStorage strategy does work. The API doesn't seem to be working and is beyond the scope of this PR.  Okay so at the end of the day, the e2e was failing because `userTheme` was undefined. Good to know I guess.  ```suggestion
  } else if (userTheme) {
```
If `userTheme` exists, we can use it to decide `selectTheme` ```suggestion
  } else if (isSysThemeDark) {
```
`thing === true` is equivalent to `thing` when it's a boolean, so we can skip the comparison."

assert.isNumber(small);
```
Why not something like this? 

https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/#method_isnumber  If that's something we're interested in , I can point out all the spots where we can change it.  Thanks for pointing that out, but I want it to be an integer and `assert.isNumber(float)` wouldn't fail. ```suggestion
Note that to see your map object properly you'll have to open the developer console.
```

I wouldn't put that, different browsers have different methods - hopefully, they know at this point. ```suggestion
Add another key-value pair to your catalog. Use your `prettyPolly` variable as the key and make the value an object with `small`, `medium`, and `large` properties whose values are integers again.
``` ```suggestion
Start by creating an object with the three properties above for the `Spanish lavender` (scientific name `Lavandula stoechas`) of a cultivar called `Ballerina` and assign it to a variable named `ballerina`.
``` ```suggestion
Now create another object, with the same three properties, to represent another cultivar of spanish lavender called `Pretty Polly`, and assign it to a variable named `prettyPolly`.
``` ```suggestion
Like regular JavaScript objects, `Map` objects contain a collection of key-value pairs. To create a `Map` object, you can use the `Map` constructor:
``` ```suggestion
Before you move on, remove the `console.log` calls from your code.
``` ```suggestion
Modify your function to return a string containing your entire catalog and log the result to the console. Build your string using the following structure for each entry in `catalog`:
``` ```suggestion
Now try to add the `ballerina` object to your `catalogSet` inside your function a second time. You'll see that nothing happens, because the object is already stored in your set and duplicate elements are not allowed in sets.
``` ```suggestion
To complete this workshop, modify your `displayPlantsSet` to return a set of the unique plant common names in your catalog.
``` ```suggestion
To achieve this, create an array of unique `commonName` values from your `catalog` keys. Pass the array to the `Set` constructor and return the set from the function.
```

I'm not sure if this is any better. Here's the solution I came up with:

<details><summary>code</summary>

```js
const displayPlantsSet = () => {
    const uniqueCommonNames = [];

    catalog.forEach((val, key) => {
        if (!uniqueCommonNames.includes(key.commonName)) {
            uniqueCommonNames.push(key.commonName)
        }
    })

    const catalogSet = new Set(uniqueCommonNames);
    return catalogSet
};
```

</details>

Could maybe mention to remove the `add` methods. The intention was to create an array with all the common names, without caring about repetitions. Then use the set constructor to get the unique values. Should I clarify that?
Anyway I'm checking just the final result. ```suggestion
Next, remove the `getBallerina` variable declaration from your code. Also remove the `console.log(getBallerina);` and `getBallerina.small = 18;` lines from your code.
``` ```suggestion
``` 
```suggestion
To test it, set the `small` property of `getBallerina` to an integer different from `20`. Then, look at the browser console to check that the value has changed in your catalog.
``` 
```suggestion
Then log `plantsSet` to the console. You'll need to open the browser console to see your set.
``` 
```suggestion
Note that to see your map object properly you'll have to open the browser console.

","I'm not sure what the issues with using React 18 and the enzyme-adapter-16 are going to be, but it's very likely that there will be some.

If we're lucky, it will be obvious when we try and write tests, but I don't know enough about how React 18 and Enzyme are incompatible to say.

I don't have an alternative right now, but we may find that we need one. I think it will work for these first few react sections. I didn't look into it much, but I think we should be able to replace enzyme with react testing library. Or, probably add it along side to start. It's tricky because RTL is designed to discourage the kind of testing we want to do. Namely, digging into the implementation details.

Don't worry about it for now, though. It's just something to keep in mind and not be too surprised about if it misbehaves. ```suggestion

The goal is to allow us to deploy (and rollback) the FSD curriculum without need to merge any code. This PR uses a Growthbook feature to control if the FSD superblock appears on the map. 

To test, fill in the GROWTHBOOK_URI env var with the development key and turn the fcc-10 feature on in the Growthbook dashboard. Pick any blocks from the FSD superblock that you want to appear and flip their `isUpcomingChange` value from `true`, to `false`. Now you should see both the FSD superblock and those blocks. It should look like this:

This PR does _not_ adjust the order of the challenges, so there's more work to be done before we can set the `isUpcomingChange` flags to false for real.

I don't know how to test the geolocation, nor how to check for error handling I would mock `navigator.geolocation` so that you would be able to test for both behaviors and not be reliant on the user's actual location and browser. 

Then test to make sure the alert appears if it is mocked to not be available. If it is mocked to be available,  I would make sure the location matches the one in the mock data. 

Let me know if you need any help implementing it.  > I would mock `navigator.geolocation` so that you would be able to test for both behaviors and not be reliant on the user's actual location and browser.

There are no requirements on function names, so the only thing would be to trigger a DOMContentLoaded event, but looking at documentation it doesn't look like that is possible. I honestly did not try to trigger a DOMContentLoaded event tho so maybe it works ü§î  TODO: update the app solution to not use the event listener for page loaded, implement a button to click to fetch the data.

ISSUES: the proxy requires lat and long, for an app with the best UI that would need to work with geolocation, which needs to also introduce [the Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API/Using_the_Permissions_API) to check if geolocation is allowed or not. Otherwise change the proxy to accept city name/zip code. Would you feel more comfortable if I updated the weather proxy to use city name and zip?  If you want, it's probably easier, I don't think we want to add also the Permission API to lecture topics I can do city name.  Looking at the [docs](https://openweathermap.org/current#name), while I can do so probably doesn't mean I should do so. Just take the city of Vienna for example. It is the capital of Austria but is also the name of a city in Canada; and the name of several cities in the United States. That being said, I could try to find a way around the issue with your solution and testing.   That being said, why not make it so the app is given latitude or longitude ; or an option to use your current location which then uses the permissions API?   it would need to be a topic added to the lectures, and the idea was already to remove the geolocation API from the lecture topics. the geolocation API needs the permissions API to verify if it's working or not. The API requires latitude and longitude, that is perfect if we use the geolocation API, but if the app is to work with user input, latitude and longitude are not the best UX A PR has been merged that renamed the certification from ""Front End"" to ""Full Stack"". This PR may need an update and a few changes made: [see comment](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56694#issuecomment-2444473378) A PR has been merged that [moves the block order from the `meta.json` file to the `full-stack.json` file.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56795) This PR will need an update, and the order will need to be removed from the `meta.json` file and moved to the new file.I think I had a little too much fun with this one @ilenia-magoni üòÉ One of my thoughts was that the demo could use a little more style - I ended up going a little overboard with my project and I'm hoping you will use it as the demo/solution...

Feel free to make changes. The only test it doesn't pass is the `13. You should have a clickHandler function.` one - which I think can be deleted - it doesn't seem necessary. I left few other comments to try and clarify some of the text.

And here's a few other things I wrote down...

I would add async to the `showWeather` user story. e.g. ""You should have an asynchronous function named `showWeather`...""

We could potentially add an example of the JSON that gets returned from the API so users don't have to look at the logs. Not necessary though.

That's about it - it's looking real good üëç 

 Just tested and it looks great. I think it would be helpful to show an example of the data returned by the API.

Is this really necessary: `If the value from the API is undefined, you should show N/A.` ? Because I didn't use the `N/A` for undefined values and I was able to pass anyway.

Also, tests take a long time to run and I think we should add some kind of note to let the users know. Initially I thought there were some issues with the environment. LGTM üéâ 

The only other thing that came to mind just now is that the weather from the API is static and not current. We could maybe mention that, but I think it's fine for now üö¢","I think I had a little too much fun with this one @ilenia-magoni üòÉ One of my thoughts was that the demo could use a little more style - I ended up going a little overboard with my project and I'm hoping you will use it as the demo/solution...

Do I need to add more tests?","Not mentioned before Not mentioned before Not mentioned before Probably there are hundreds of better ways to say it more correctly.
```suggestion

1. You should have an async function named `checkPermissions` that queries the geolocation permissions  and returns the value of the `state` property.

``` ```suggestion
    assert.include(testArr[0], ""This is a test error"");
    assert.lengthOf(testArr, 1);
``` ```suggestion
1. You should have a `select` element with seven `option` elements nested within it. The first option should have an empty string as its text and `value` attribute. The rest should have the follow for their text and values (with the value being lowercase):
``` ```suggestion
1. The `getWeather` asynchronous function should accept a city as its argument.
``` ```suggestion
1. The `showWeather` function should call the `getWeather` function to retrieve the weather data for the selected city from the dropdown.
``` I would just remove this test. It's not mentioned in the user stories and doesn't seem like it needs to be required. ```suggestion
The `getWeather` function should accept a city as it's only argument and return the JSON from the Weather API.
``` ""If the value from the API is `undefined`, you should show `N/A`.""

This isn't mentioned in the user stories. Seems like it should be if we're going to test for it. ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
1. If the data from `getWeather` are usable, the `showWeather` function should display the weather data in the corresponding elements. If a certain value from the API is `undefined`, you should write `N/A` in the corresponsing element.
``` ```suggestion
You will use a weather API. The output data has the following format:

","I vote we simplify this 

```suggestion
## React
``` ```suggestion
- Examples of frameworks include Angular and Next.js.
```
React describes itself as 

>The library for web and native user interfaces ```suggestion
- A couple of examples of JavaScript libraries are jQuery and React.
```
If you want to mention React, it makes more sense here. ```suggestion
- SPAs use JavaScript to manage the application's state and render content. This is often done using frameworks which provide great tools for building complex user interfaces.
```
I don't think we need to list them again, tbh. We never officially discussed this but there is a difference in formatting here between the different review pages.
Since we will have different team members in 2025 working on these pages there should be a consensus.

Do we want just bullet points?
Or the way it was originally setup? 

```md
- **topic**: placeholder
``` ```suggestion
  - Screen readers struggle struggle with dynamically updated content.
``` This section needs to be removed because that lecture script was moved to another module This section also needs to be updated to match the script.
The script now focus just on how to setup a react app using vite this needs to be removed because meta frameworks were moved to another module ```suggestion
- The UI is described using JSX, an extension of JavaScript's syntax, that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
```
I'm not sure about this, but just having ""syntax extension"" alone made me think ""extension to what?"" We also need to add the section for imports and exports because that script was added a few days ago I'm probably old-fashioned, but isn't a meta framework just a framework? ```suggestion
## Dependency management
```
It doesn't seem like there's anything React specific to managing deps. ```suggestion
- Dependency management refers to the process of handling external code packages that your project relies on. These packages, also known as dependencies, can range from small utility functions to large libraries like React.
```
Nit: I'd just call it React. Also, if we want to call it React JS or whatever, we should introduce the aliases with the thing itself.
 ```suggestion
- Props can be any JavaScript value. To pass props from a parent to a child component, you add the props as attributes when you use the child component in the parent's JSX. Here's a simple example:
```
Maybe include examples, too, but just including examples implies that they're the only allowed values. ```suggestion
- Another way to conditionally render content is to use the logical AND (`&&`) operator. This is useful when you want to render content only if a certain condition is met. Here's an example:
``` Yeah, I think this review page was created before the technical reviews were done for the react scripts. I think in the revised script it mentions other examples of frameworks. So we should just list the ones from the script.  In the docs, they mention syntax extension but then follow it up a few sentences later with how components combine ""rendering logic and markup"".
https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx

So maybe some sort of rewording of what is outlined in the docs? Yeah, it seems like meta frameworks are mainly just used in the JS community. But none of the major frameworks like Remix or NextJS call themselves that in their docs. 

So probably the lecture title could be updated to just frameworks. But also this section is being removed because it shouldn't be in this particular review page üëç  Sure. These are all slightly fuzzy terms and some people do call React a framework, but if there are more clear-cut examples, that's great. removed updated removed added I updated the script to mention NextJS too since it hasn't been recorded yet ```suggestion
- A core concept of React is the creation of reusable UI components that can update and render independently as data changes.
``` ```suggestion

Buttons not being clickable might have something to do with a hydration issue. Mainly when the button UI is loaded but the functionality of the button itself is not. Making the button not clickable.

Here's a video that explains it:

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","For `toPass` to be useful, there have to be assertions inside the callback. What it does is keep calling the callback until either it passes or something times out (the test, probably). If there are no assertions it immediately resolves, so it doesn't help.

Instead, what you need to do is assert that we've ended up in the expected state. In this case, we can check that the `Add a new portfolio Item` button is disabled, since that happens in response to a successful click.

TL;DR: the callback needs to assert that something has happened in response to the click. ```suggestion
```
Is this necessary? It's a very long time for a test. ```suggestion

    // Will check if the portfolio button is hydrated correctly with different intervals.
    await expect(async () => {
      const addPortfolioItemButton = page.getByRole('button', {
        name: 'Add a new portfolio Item'
      });
      await addPortfolioItemButton.click();

      await expect(addPortfolioItemButton).toBeDisabled({ timeout: 1 });
    }).toPass();
```
So, the thing is, there's no point re-checking if the button is disabled without clicking it. The problem is that if playwright clicks too early, the button click doesn't do anything, so waiting for even longer (i.e. what `toPass` does) just makes the test take longer to fail.

The way to think about `toPass` is that it lets you retry something unreliable (clicking) until it finally succeeds (button is disabled). You have to do both in the callback for that to work. I must not have been thinking straight üôÉ "

When adding the cards styles, there should be some padding so the buttons such as edit don't stick to the card border.

There are two way of moving forward:
1) add sections and add padding.
2) Style the columns.

Both have pros and cons, I would prefer the second because the columns have a padding by default and adding a section with padding would result in a narrower usable area.

The Stat section could be rename to activity and the activity map and the stat numbers could be in one card since they are related enough. They two parts of the activity section should be divided by an hr element. Use hr elements only between parts of the cards not between the cards themselves.

We would need to make the map shorter (include all year), but that is for another pr.


Finally, the bio would look strange if it is within a card in. I see you have not include it in a card, but for consistency the card need to be adjusted so it only covers the related text.

There is another feature coming for profile customizability, we could align another button with the image to take care of that.

Here is a quick mock of the suggestions above:


<img width=""1018"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 3 29 56‚ÄØPM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78d7c5ba-52f2-4188-9653-19455fce3461"">

 Hey @ahmaxed,

Thank you for your feedback, I have added the card to the bio component as well for consistency. I wanted to make sure the username and the edit button were aligned instead of having them on different margins. 

The avatar image still feels a bit off, it doesn't feel quite right yet. If you have any suggestions for that let me know. 

For merging the Heatmap and the Stats component we would not only have to think about the user experience but also about how we would update the logic for hiding the components. For example, Heatmap and Stats component both have a toggle on the settings page. Meaning the user experience will be different for everyone.

For the stats component itself, the headers for the statistics look good, but the points do not conform well with them. They are bigger than the header.

Please let me know what you think about these issues. There are no major issues. If you resolve the conflicts and let me know, I could add the remaining styles real quick.

Looking at the handler code, it's used to check if the user has already attempted a quiz. However, the presence of a completed challenge with the quiz's challengeId already does that. I believe we talked about having multiple question sets for a single quiz challenge, so that campers won't always get the same set when they take the quiz.

Here is the client code that supports the behavior:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/67e09c86791cf5c4e042fa19387eab3f4013ce54/client/src/templates/Challenges/quiz/show.tsx#L135-L136

I'm having the endpoint accepts the `quizId` to record that information. But I guess it should be named `questionSetId` instead, to be clearer? You're quite right - I'd completely forgotten there are going to be multiple quizzes as part of the same challenge.

I have a followup concern, though! The array index isn't a stable id, since we may add more quizzes in the future. Unless we remember to append them to the ""array"", this user may end up being given the wrong quiz/blocked for no good reason. 

If that makes sense, I'll create another issue for that. This PR is fine, though.

One thing I was mulling over was: do we want to keep an array of their previous attempts? I think we _could_ since it will help if we ever have 3+ quizzes, but we don't need to yet, so YAGNI applies!



 > I have a followup concern, though! The array index isn't a stable id, since we may add more quizzes in the future. Unless we remember to append them to the ""array"", this user may end up being given the wrong quiz/blocked for no good reason.

Yup. This is a legitimate concern üëç 

> One thing I was mulling over was: do we want to keep an array of their previous attempts? I think we could since it will help if we ever have 3+ quizzes, but we don't need to yet, so YAGNI applies!

Yeah I'm not sure how many previous attempts we want to keep track of. 

What I have in mind at the moment is:
- We don't care if the camper has already passed the quiz (whether the `challengeId` is in the `completedChallenges` array)
- We record the latest attempt of each question set
  - If camper attempts HTML quiz - question set A for the first time, we add this to the array as a new item
  - If camper attempts HTML quiz - question set B for the first time, we add this to the array as a new item
  - If camper attempts CSS quiz - question set A for the first time, we add this to the array as a new item
  - If camper attempts HTML quiz - question set A for the second time, we update the timestamp of the corresponding item
- The `quizAttempts` and `completedChallenges` information can allow us to determine:
  - If a cool-down period should be enforced
    - This is true if the `challengeId` is not in the `completedChallenges` array
  - Which question set should be used when the camper takes a quiz
    - We could filter the `quizAttempts` array by `challengeId`, compare the `timestamp` to know which question set was last used, and exclude that from the random selection @huyenltnguyen @ojeytonwilliams 

Would it help if we added a second quiz, so the two of you could test things out further?
I would be able to wip up a second HTML basic quiz real quick.

After we come back from Christmas break, we were planning to add in the other sets of quizzes. We could hold off on that if it is going to create issues with how to handle quiz attempts @jdwilkin4 It depends how many quizzes we're going to need per challenge. If it's only 2, we can get away with storing a single quizId. If it later turns out to be 3 or more, we may need to migrate from storing an single quizId to an array of them, but that's okay. > If it later turns out to be 3 or more, we may need to migrate from storing an single quizId to an array of them, but that's okay.

Originally, I was thinking maybe 3. But now I am thinking 2 should suffice.

I am really hoping that most campers will pass the first time. If not, they will look again at the review page, and pass the second time. 
Hopefully, we don't have a situation where most campers are taking the quiz 3+ times.

So 2 should suffice IMO. But we can hear what tom thinks too üëç 



 @ojeytonwilliams I'm curious what data structure you have in mind.

I'm having the `quizAttempts` array looking like this:

```ts
// Pseudo code
[
  {
    challengeId: 'quiz-basic-html',
    quizId: '0',
    timestamp: ...
  },
  {
    challengeId: 'quiz-basic-html',
    quizId: '1',
    timestamp: ...
  },
  {
    challengeId: 'quiz-basic-css',
    quizId: '0',
    timestamp: ...
  },
  {
    challengeId: 'quiz-basic-css',
    quizId: '1',
    timestamp: ...
  },
]
```

It should allow multiple quizzes (even 3+) per challenge, unless I'm missing something.
 > unless I'm missing something.

Nope, I am. For some reason, I was thinking we need an array of quizIds

```js
[
  {
    challengeId: 'quiz-basic-html',
    quizId: ['0', '1', ...],
    timestamp: ...
  },
]
```

...but I can't justify it :cold_sweat: 
 This is looking good @huyenltnguyen üëç The only thing I might say we don't need, is to store all the quiz attempts. I was leaning towards just the most recent one - which should be enough. But I guess more info wouldn't really hurt? > The only thing I might say we don't need, is to store all the quiz attempts. I was leaning towards just the most recent one - which should be enough.

@moT01 Yeah I wasn't sure how much information we want to store. I'm currently saving the most recent attempt of each challenge - question set pair, but maybe saving one per challenge ID should be enough.
 It depends what we're storing the quiz ids for. If we store just one, we can differentiate between two states:

1. Learner hasn't done a quiz
2. Learner has done one specific version (question set) of a quiz. We also know when they did it.

We can't tell if a learner has done more than one question set, though.

So, if all we want is to do is prevent the same question set appearing twice in a row and, potentially, prevent submissions during a cooldown period, then storing one quizId is enough. If we want other features, it probably isn't sufficient. > So, if all we want is to do is prevent the same question set appearing twice in a row and, potentially, prevent submissions during a cooldown period

We only need the information for these two purposes at the moment. I can't think of any features we would potentially add that require us to know/store all attempts or all question sets that the camper has taken.",,"Checklist:

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","I'll have a separate PR to update the other tests to use fake timers.

Tracking issue: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/57233. I'm only adding this to `/get-session-user`. I don't think `/get-public-profile` needs this information. What I have in mind is:
- The client calls this API when the camper clicks the submit quiz button, regardless of the quiz result.
- On the backend, we store a single attempt for each quiz, and the attempt is the latest one.

Using the `completedChallenges` array, we know whether or not the camper has passed the quiz. And the attempt information here allows us to:
- Enforce a cool-down period if the camper has failed the quiz.
- Use a different quiz question set if the camper has already passed the quiz and wants to re-do it (we only have a single question set at the moment, but this could be a future feature).
 Note: Quiz questions set are stored in an array, and their IDs are their index number. So client will need to perform some parsing when it sends or receives the `quizId`. Do we need to return this? The client knows when it sent the request, after all. ```suggestion
      const existingAttempt = user.quizAttempts.find(
        matches({ quizId, challengeId })
      );
```
lodash's matches cleans this up a little, imo. 

The change from findIndex to find is mostly cosmetic. If we use the mongo array manipulation methods (see below!) we only care if we've found something, not which index it is. This works fine, but I suspect we're better off making use of the tools Mongo gives us for array manipulation:

```ts
      await fastify.prisma.user.update({
        where: { id: user.id },
        data: {
          quizAttempts: existingAttempt
            ? {
                updateMany: { where: { challengeId, quizId }, data: newAttempt }
              }
            : { push: newAttempt }
        }
      });
```


 Yeah I'm following the `*-completed` endpoints here. The client doesn't include the `completedDate` value in the request; the value is created on the backend and returned to the client via the response.

Are you suggesting creating and sending the value from the client instead?

I guess an edge case would be, a camper fails a quiz and the client optimistically locks the quiz, but the API call fails so the attempt is never recorded, and the camper can retake the quiz without having to wait for the cool-down period. > Are you suggesting creating and sending the value from the client instead?

Nope, I just don't see the purpose of returning the current time. It doesn't tell the client anything it doesn't already know (it can call Date.now if it wants), so why bother? We can use this, but if we want to localise it, we should use a flash message.

It's okay for now, though!"

I have restructured the instructions a bit, to improve readability. It is totally up to you if you'd like to update.

<details>
  <summary>Updated instructions</summary>

```md

1. You should have a `div` with a class of `blog-post-card` to hold all your card elements.
2. You should have an image with a valid `alt` text and the class of `post-img`. You can use `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/cover-photo.jpg` for the `src` attribute of your image.
3. You should have a `div` with a class of `post-content`. 
Within the `.post-content` `div`:

    - You should have a `h2` with a class of `post-title`. Assign some text to act as the title of your blog post.
    - You should have a `p` with a class of `post-excerpt`. Assign some text to summarize the blog post (maximum of 20 words).
    - You should have an `a` with a class of `read-more`. Assign the text `Read More` to it.

4. You should apply the following styles to the `blog-post-card` div:

   - A white colored background.
   - Rounded corners.
   - Shadow for depth.
   - Appropriate `overflow` property to prevent content from overflowing.
   - Width of your choice.
   - Text alignment of your choice.

5. The `post-img` class should ensure that the image fills the card's width and adds a border at the bottom.
6. The `post-content` class should add padding inside the card for spacing.
7. The `post-title` and `post-excerpt` elements within `post-content` should have a text color other than the default and a margin on all sides.
8. The `read-more` element should be styled like a button and have:
   
   - A text color other than the default.
   - Background color.
   - Margin on all sides.
   - A `display` property of `inline-block`. 
   - Rounded corners
   - Padding on all sides.

9.  The `read-more` element should have a hover effect that changes the background color.

**Note:** Be sure to link your stylesheet in your HTML and apply your CSS.

```

</details>

Also, I feel there is some repetition, for example background colors, borders and padding are being tested more than once.
If a property has been tested once, we can test for other properties in other classes. Does that make sense?
 A PR has been merged that renamed the certification from ""Front End"" to ""Full Stack"". This PR may need an update and a few changes made: [see comment](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56694#issuecomment-2444473378) A PR has been merged that [moves the block order from the `meta.json` file to the `full-stack.json` file.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56795) This PR will need an update, and the order will need to be removed from the `meta.json` file and moved to the new file. @ihechikara

Using `searchPageUrl` directly seems fine, tbh. Since `!query` means we return `null`, you can just do that first and simplify the logic to `if (hasHits)`. That or `return hasHits ? ... : ...`

 I think this also needs to react to mouse enters and leaves. `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` should do the trick."

No need to, all commits will be squashed into single one when PR is merged. My feedback on the question set is that: 
- It has quite a lot of similar questions (those ""Given the following code with recursion, what does the code return?"")
- It has multiple questions that cover the same topic
- It does not cover call stack
- It does not cover head recursion

I went ahead and updated the PR. I ended up making quite a lot of changes, so I won't give my approval for this one. Other sets of eyes are needed here üôÇ . @huyenltnguyen it was kind of hard to differentiate where to draw the line as far as what was a beginning question. For me at least üëåüèª

I could adjust the questions more too if you would like. 

Thanks üëçüèª @huyenltnguyen 

I was able to take a quick look and I think things looks good.
The only thing is we need to just verify if a couple of concepts like head recursion are taught in the lecture video. I think it is but we should double check to make sure üëç 

So, if you can review the script on the sheet to make sure all of the concepts mentioned in the quiz can be found in the script, that would be great.
Then we should be good with approving and merging in this PR Thanks for giving it a look, Jessica!

I checked out the lecture script and did not find any mentions of head or tail recursion. So I guess the quiz needs to be updated to remove those questions then?

A couple of questions that I think should be replaced also (the concepts aren't mentioned):
- What feature do browsers implement to prevent infinite recursion?
- Which of the following techniques can improve the performance of recursive functions?

I'll try to think of questions to replace those. I'm currently only having 2 in mind:
- Given a recursion without a base case, choose the correct base case for it
- When to choose recursion over iteration and/or the trade-offs of the two
  - I guess I would form this question as a ""choose the correct statement"" kind > I checked out the lecture script and did not find any mentions of head or tail recursion. So I guess the quiz needs to be updated to remove those questions then?

Yes. If it wasn't taught, then we can't quiz them on it. So either the script needs to be updated or you will need to remove the questions.

> A couple of questions that I think should be replaced also (the concepts aren't mentioned):

Those will need to be removed as well and replaced with other questions

","the question doesn't match the answers, maybe you want to put a code snippet in each answer? this is not recursion, you must use the returned value of the function call for it to be proper recursion ```suggestion
`3`
``` ```suggestion
`0`
``` ```suggestion
`1`
``` ```suggestion
`6`
``` this is not a good example of recursion as it doesn't use the returned value of the function call what is this line for? this quiz is for recursion is JavaScript, bringing in other languages would be confusing the name of the function gives it away. If you want the camper to interpret the function gives it a generic name please maybe this is not the best example? it's a quite resource intesive way to check if a number is even or not ```suggestion
`undefined`
``` ```suggestion
`false`
``` ```suggestion
`true`
``` I am not sure this is the correct response. `return` terminates a function executing and establish the output Whoops I thought I took out the 2nd line in this one üòÖ 
I'll take it out üëçüèª Okay cool, I get that. 
Do you want me to swap it out with a different question?

I don't mind switching out a couple üëçüèª
As long as I don't have to change them all ü§£ Yeah that one wasn't my best üòÇ

Do you want my to make it just an `if/else` or should I just swap it out for a modulus `%`?

Thanks buddy üòÑ I have fixed this one, and added code examples to choose from instead.  I changed this one to:

```javascript
function isEven(n) {
  return n === 0 ? true : n === 1 ? false : isEven(n - 2);
}
console.log(isEven(4));
```

Do you think that is too complex, or would you like me to go in another direction?
Thanks ```suggestion
```
Not sure if GitHub will use this suggestion correctly, but please remove the two newly added blank lines after the question, so there's only the original blank line left. By the _definition_ from previous question every option is valid. This question is very similar to first question. ```suggestion
What will this function return?
``` Unless original array has only single element or is empty, in which case it will be the same original array. ```suggestion
What will this code log to console?
```"

This allows lesson authors to write their JSX in a separate ""file"", import it and use it in another HTML file.

For this to work

* the html file must have a script with attributes `data-plugins=""transform-modules-umd""`, `type=""text/babel""` and `src=""index.jsx""` (or `.\index.jsx`, both work)
* the index.jsx file (i.e. the contents of the jsx editor) must export whatever properties you want to use in the html file
* the html file must have a script with `type=""text/babel""`
* that script must import whatever you want from the index.jsx file

At least, all of those _should_ be required. If you can work around any of them, that's a bug!

The DEBUG commit contains an example of how to do this, so you can play with it on http://localhost:8000/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-38 (step 38 chosen for no particular reason).

I've not experimented with the attributes all that much (i.e. which is necessary and why), but the gist is the user experience should be something like https://stackoverflow.com/a/73911607.

Finally, there's a known issue: the multifile editor order is wrong. This should be an easy fix, but this PR already does a lot!

Yep! The idea is to provide an extra layer of protection to the mobile-login handler. Thing is, if they're logged in, the handler is never reached, so it's protected.Bye ~~Felicia~~ Express! Works.

<!--If your pull request closes a GitHub issue, replace the XXXXX below with the issue number.-->

I was looking into migrating Fastify to V5 and noticed we're still using an express plugin. This removes express entirely.

It did mean I had to ""patch"" the rate limit store, since their `incr` signatures were different, so there's more code than I'd like. However, when we use redis (see: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/50631) all the custom code can be dropped, since fastify/rate-limit supports redis out of the box.

","```suggestion
- **Definition**: In programming, inheritance allows you to define classes that inherit properties and methods from parent classes. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. A parent class is a class that acts like a blueprint for other classes. It defines properties and methods that are inherited by other classes. A child class is a class that inherits the properties and methods of another class. Child classes can also extend the functionality of their parent classes by adding new properties and methods. In JavaScript, we use the `extends` keyword to implement inheritance. This keyword indicates that a class is the child class of another class.

 @jdwilkin4 the updated stories are ready for another review. @jdwilkin4 ready for another review. @moT01 implemented the suggested changes and ready for another review. @Dario-DC how is it looking now? I committed Jessica's suggestion, the regex I suggested had redundant forward slashes. Hope you don't mind @fhsinchy  Ah thanks a lot @Dario-DC and @jdwilkin4, I fell asleep and woke up to a merged PR.Some tests are a bit too strict. Maybe we can ask to create other two named callback functions, to be passed to filter and forEach. It could simplify the testing.

Not sure if this would work with filter though. Because the filtering expression can be anything according to the user story. I found a couple of issues. I was able to pass with the following code:

","```suggestion
challengeType: 14
``` I would place this as the first user story to clarify the structure of book objects since the beginning. `release_year` should be `releaseYear` to stick to JS convention. The same applies for the other variable names. I would also check that the title and author name are not empty strings. You can use `assert.isNotEmpty` It doesn't allow to declare `filteredBooks` with `const`. Also, the following should be allowed to pass:

```js
const callback = book => book.release_year > 1975;
const filteredBooks = books.filter(callback);
```
```js
const filteredBooks = books.filter( i => i.release_year > 1998)
``` Any suggestions on how I can make it so that any of these three passes the test? After careful consideration, these 3 user stories and their corresponding hints and tests should be more open ended. It will go more with the spirit of the labs and match better with the other labs.

We already have the workshop that comes immediately before this where the tests are much stricter to look for `filter,` `forEach`, etc. 

In this lab, it should be more open ended and not dependent on regex tests. We will just test the final outcome with other assert methods. 

The wording for all of these should be updated to just check that they have create the variable and assigned it the result of a filtered array, or sorted array, etc.

This will mean that some campers might use other methods for solving this, but I actually think that is ok because like I mentioned earlier, we do have the workshop that will be testing for specific methods üëç  These should be updated based on my earlier comment üëç  I have updated the stories to leave out any concrete solutions and rely on the camper's discretion. I have update the tests to check if the array is sorted in a different way. Working on the filtering test and the last one. ```suggestion
3. You should have a callback function named `sortByYear` that accepts two books as parameter for sorting the array.
```
Since the naming is free I would remove `book1` and `book2` from this user story and refer to them as ""the first book"" or ""the second book"" in the other user stories. What are the other scenarios? The two release years being equal? ````suggestion

Your `sortByYear` function should take two parameters.

```js
assert.lengthOf(sortByYear, 2);
```

```` There's no test for this user story I am working on the filtering and sorting bits. Working on these two. Didn't know I could do that. Thanks! Yes. Should I mention that instead of ""other scenarios""? It's a quite recent discovery :smile:  It would be less confusing probably :+1:  I've added test for the 8th story and removed the 9th one. This needs to go after the library manager (2 below this) ```suggestion
```

We can probably just get rid of these I think. This can go below the library manager. Not that it really matters, but we've been trying to keep them in order. ```suggestion
8. You should sort the books in the `filteredBooks` array according to their `releaseYear` in ascending order and save the sorted array in a new array named `filteredBooksSorted`.
```

I think you mean this here? You could also maybe add to ""use your sortByYear function"". ```suggestion
The `filteredBooksSorted` array should have some of the books filtered out from it and not be empty.
``` ````suggestion

The `filteredBooks` array should have some of the books filtered out from the `books` array and not be empty.

```js
assert.isBelow(filteredBooks.length, books.length)
assert.isNotEmpty(filteredBooks)
```

```` ````suggestion
The `filteredBooksSorted` array should have the same length of `filteredBooks`.

```js
assert.lengthOf(filteredBooksSorted, filteredBooks.length)
```
```` ```suggestion
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), //(const|let)\s+filteredBooksSorted\s*=\s*filteredBooks\s*\.\s*sort\s*\(\s*sortByYear\s*\)//)
```
What if we regex this? Like @jdwilkin4 said on the meeting, we don't want to force the campers to use the sort method here. They're free to sort the array using any method they want. Initially I used regex and later on removed it based on the feedback I got.

I've updated the wording of the test report a little bit. Can you take a look and see if it sounds better?

Also I've implemented all the other code changes you suggested as they seemed very appropriate. Please do a re-review and let me know if you think I should make any further changes."

I have made the following changes:

- Removed the `updateBalance` method entirely along with user stories and tests.
- Extended the user stories and tests.

Let me know if these changes are good to go.What do you think of adding a test that check if `this.transactions` contains the right objects? This was fun @zairahira üéâ I left a few comments to try and clarify some of the user stories. Other than that, LGTM üéâ 

One thing that we could do to expand this a little is make a few more user stories like:
""You should create a new instance of `BankAccount` named `myAccount`.""
""Your `myAccount` bank account should have at least five transactions.""
""Your `myAccount` bank account should have at least two deposits.""
""Your `myAccount` bank account should have at least two withdrawals.""
""Your `myAccount` bank account should have a balance greater than $100.""

Something like that. They would be pretty easy to write and write tests for - feel free to add something like that if you want. Otherwise, I'm fine with getting this in without that.

Actually, now that a take a second look - the `updateBalance` function doesn't really seem like it's needed or something. Here's the code I wrote based on the user story:

<details><summary>code</summary>

```js
updateBalance({type, amount}) {
  type === 'deposit' ? this.balance += amount : this.balance -= amount;
}
```

</details>

It doesn't explain that I am supposed to go through all the transactions and update the balance (found out by looking at your solution). I guess I was a little confused. Here's the code I used to pass:

<details><summary>code</summary>

```js
class BankAccount {
  constructor() {
    this.balance = 0;
    this.transactions = [];
  }

  updateBalance({type, amount}) {
    type === 'deposit' ? this.balance += amount : this.balance -= amount;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    if(amount > 0) {
      this.balance += amount;
      this.transactions.push({ type: 'deposit', amount })
      return `Successfully deposited $${amount}. New balance: $${this.balance}`;
    } else {
      return ""Deposit amount must be greater than zero.""
    }
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if(amount > 0 && this.balance >= amount) {
      this.balance -= amount;
      this.transactions.push({ type: 'withdraw', amount })
      return `Successfully withdrew $${amount}. New balance: $${this.balance}`;
    } else {
      return ""Insufficient balance or invalid amount.""
    }
  }

  checkBalance() {
    return `Current balance: $${this.balance}`
  }

  listAllDeposits() {
    const deposits = this.transactions.filter(t => t.type === 'deposit');
    return `Deposits: ${deposits.map(d => d.amount).join(',')}`
  }

  listAllWithdrawals() {
    const withdrawals = this.transactions.filter(t => t.type === 'withdraw');
    return `Withdrawals: ${withdrawals.map(w => w.amount).join(',')}`
  }
}
```

</details>

Note that I just use `this.balance +=/-= amount` in the `deposit`/`withdraw` methods - so I didn't use the `updateBalance` function. Now that I read the user stories again (""Update the balance""), I see that that's what you intended me to do. I think I would vote to just remove that user story and the tests for it - but we could keep it as well. I would clarify some of those user stories if we do - maybe...

User Story 3:

```
Inside the `BankAccount` class, you should define a method named
`updateBalance` that goes through the `transactions` array and updates
the balance according to the type of transaction. If the transaction type is
`deposit`, it should add the amount to the balance. If the transaction type
is `withdraw`, it should subtract the amount from the balance.

Modified the original prototype by replacing `console.log` statements with `return` statements.

","```suggestion
1. You should define a class named `BankAccount` with a constructor that takes `balance` as a parameter. The constructor should set the `balance` to `0` if no value is provided and initialize an empty array named `transactions` to store transaction records as objects.
``` ```suggestion
2. Each transaction stored in the `transactions` array should be an object with two properties: `type` and `amount`. The `type` property should be either `deposit` or `withdraw`, and the `amount` property should be the amount deposited or withdrawn.
``` ```suggestion
3. Inside the `BankAccount` class, you should define a method named `updateBalance` that updates the balance according to the type of transaction. If the transaction type is `deposit`, it should add the amount to the balance. If the transaction type is `withdraw`, it should subtract the amount from the balance.
``` I think transactions is an array and not an object? ```suggestion
8. You should define a method named `checkBalance` that returns the current balance in the format `""Current balance: ${balance}""`.
``` I have used square brackets as placeholders here and not as template literals. The constructor would always set balance to `0` and doesn't accept other values. ```suggestion
8. You should define a method named `checkBalance` that returns the current balance in the format `""Current balance: $<balance>""`.
```

I have seen in the curriculum most often the angular brackets to signal placeholder I am a bit confused but let's go with the optimal option @zairahira  ```suggestion
3. Inside the `BankAccount` class, you should define a method named `updateBalance` that updates the balance using the `transactions` list, according to the type of transaction. If the transaction type is `deposit`, it should add the amount to the balance. If the transaction type is `withdraw`, it should subtract the amount from the balance.
```

I was really confused on what this method should do, there was no mention on using the list of all transactions to calculate the balance. ```suggestion
superBlock: full-stack-developer
``` ```suggestion
  ""superBlock"": ""full-stack-developer"",
``` The transactions is not a list, but there is a `transaction` array that has 2 types of transactions: `deposit` and `withdraw`. ```suggestion
1. You should define a class named `BankAccount` with a constructor that takes `balance` as parameter. The constructor should set the default `balance` to `0` and initialize an empty array named `transactions` to store transaction records as objects. 
``` What is the point of taking a parameter if `balance` is set to 0 anyway? ```suggestion
5. If the amount is less than or equal to `0`, the `deposit` method should return `""Deposit amount must be greater than zero.""`.
``` ```suggestion
7. If the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to `0` or greater than the current balance, the `withdraw` method should return `""Insufficient balance or invalid amount.""`.
``` There's no test for `updateBalance` ```suggestion
    constructor() {
      this.balance = 0;
```
If the balance is always supposed to be empty when the account is created, then I think the code should be updated as well as the first user story. Makes sense üëçÔ∏è This is being tested inside `withdraw()` and `deposit()`. Should I still write separate tests? I don't think so. My `updateBalance` was empty and it passed the tests. ```suggestion
4. You should define a method named `deposit` that takes the deposit amount as a parameter. When the deposit amount is greater than `0`, it should:
```

This part seems redundant. It says to update the balance below. ```suggestion
   - Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of `deposit` and the amount deposited.
``` ```suggestion
   - Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of `withdraw` and the amount withdrawn.
``` ```suggestion
9. You should define a method named `listAllDeposits` that iterates through the transactions array and returns all deposits in the format `""Deposits: amount,amount,...""`.
```

I think this makes it a little more clear. ```suggestion
10. You should define a method named `listAllWithdrawals` that iterates through the transactions array and returns all withdrawals in the format `""Withdrawals: amount,amount,...""`.
```

It is currently giving me C vibes instead of JS vibes I don't quite understand what you mean by C vibes but I would be happy to fix it.  I think I just fixed it.  When I was learning C, they would place the curly braces on a newline

- **`for` Loop**: This type of loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. This loop is broken up into three parts: initialization statement, condition, and the increment/decrement statement. The initialization statement is executed before the loop starts. It is typically used to initialize a counter variable. The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. An iteration is a single pass through the loop. If the condition is `true`, the code block inside the loop is executed. If the condition is `false`, the loop stops and you move on to the next block of code. The increment/decrement statement is executed after each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to increment or decrement the counter variable.

This looks really cool so far. ü•≥ 

My only concern with the design is that I am not sure we have solved the issue of campers starting wherever they want to.
In the past, any time we have a list of blocks, we always get questions of should they start at the top or can they just pick randomly from the list.

For example:
https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/where-to-start-with-fcc/591803

So, is there any way to make it super clear in the chapters list that you can only start at the top? Maybe the other content can be greyed out or someway indicated that it is not available and you have no choice but to start at the top? > My only concern with the design is that I am not sure we have solved the issue of campers starting wherever they want to.

I'm not sure that needs to be solved on this PR. We do intend to add something to let people know that they skipped some challenges. Hey @huyenltnguyen, I ended up hacking at the superblock accordion for a bit and I think it's a little clearer now.

The basic ideas are as follows 

* do the (potentially) expensive stuff in the memo, but leave the majority of code outside. 
* transform the flat challenge structure into chapters, modules and blocks to make rendering simpler

That's it, really! Let me know what you think and I'll finish the review.

By the way, I love the design and how easy it is to navigate with the keyboard! Your changes look good to me. Thanks, Oliver! üëç  This PR is missing the rendering logic for prep exams (it's currently only handling the final exam).

Oliver already approved the PR, so I don't want to drag him back.

This PR:
- Requires #56795 for the super block data
- Requires #56808 for the block layout split. FSD is currently sharing the component with other superblocks, so the split allows us to make styling adjustments without interfering with those
- Updates the FSD super page to display the curriculum in a multi-level accordion 
  - I'm not using the term ""tree view"" because of a change in the implementation approach (see the ""Implementation"" section below). The display is not affected by this change, though.
- Is related to https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/fCC10/issues/6

This is a _very_ rough version. Feedback and further iterations are needed. A couple things I think we could do:
- Make chapter labels display similarly to super blocks (with a border and an icon)
  - Icon: I think we could give HTML, CSS, JS, etc. icons to the corresponding chapter
  - Color: I'll need some help here if we want to apply a border and background colors to the chapters. I tried making them look like super block items, but IMHO they don't blend very well with the nested content

## Implementation approach

### TL;DR

I experimented with the tree view pattern using Material UI, got the functionality we want, but came across a performance issue.

I also wasn't happy with the keyboard navigation pattern, so I explored a little more and fell into an a11y rabbit hole. Basically the behavior we want to achieve with tree view is quite complicated, and the specification is still being discussed by the Internet Elders.

I decided to just display the content as a nested accordion. The UI is identical to my previous version, but the a11y is better (or at least less awkward).

### Details

<details>

<summary>Implementation approach in detail</summary>

Before we get to the details, here is an overly simplified definition of ""tree view pattern"":
- The pattern is used to organized elements in a hierarchical list.
- In this pattern, the outer-most element (or root node) has the `tree` role, and all of its children (child nodes) have the `treeitem` role regardless of whether or not they have child nodes themselves; the grandchild nodes would also have the `treeitem` role.
- In this pattern, users will navigate the tree using Arrow keys, instead of Tab and Enter/Spacebar like with most interactive elements:
  - Left or Right Arrow keys to expand or collapse a tree item.
  - Up or Down Arrow keys to move up or down the node level.
- The `treeitem` role only accepts non-interactive elements.
  - This is not entirely true, or at least the HTML specification is currently unclear. But even if interactive elements are allowed, it is still not clear how the keyboard interaction would be.
  - See https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/1251 and https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/1440.

The keyboard interaction is what I'm concerned about. Our `ChallengeList` and `ChallengeGrid` blocks render the challenge list within a widget (a panel that is only visible when its trigger button is clicked), so if we put them in a `tree` we have the following DOM:

```html
<!-- Pseudo code -->
<ul role=""tree"">
  <li role=""treeitem"">Chapter One</li>
    <li role=""treeitem"">Module One</li>	
      <li role=""treeitem"">
        <button onClick={expandChallengeList}>Block One</button>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenge One</li>
          <li>Challenge Two</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </li>
  </li>	
</ul>
```

The keyboard interaction of this structure would be cumbersome, since it involves a mix of Arrow keys (to go down to the last `treeitem`), Tab (to focus on the button), and Enter/Space key (to trigger the button). And since this is a scenario that is being discussed in the W3C issues above, I'm not comfortable implementing it without knowing the a11y requirements/recommendations.

I decided to render the curriculum as a multi-level accordion instead. The hierarchy is communicated by the `ul` and `li`  elements under the hood, and visually by the indentation.

### Other implementation notes

(This is just for posterity. I'm not going with tree view so Material UI isn't needed.)

The rendering seems to be fine, I didn't experience any lag in the display. However, the clean up operation broke the page. 

The reason is that, on unmount, MUI (the library we use for Tree View) calls a [`getNodesToRemove` function](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/85e421035df0d7b22f122f8f8d65a120c38436e3/packages/material-ui-lab/src/TreeView/TreeView.js#L408-L421). The function runs recursively down the tree to get all of the tree nodes, including the nodes' content, meaning it would run against all challenges listed in the blocks. And I think the thousands of function calls trigger the error.

To reproduce:
- On /learn, go to the FSD super block
- On the FSD super block page, click on another super block
- See that the page will throw ""too much recursion""

(Non-)Solution:

I wasn't sure what could be done on our end to resolve the issue. Due to the React version constraint, we can only use a deprecated MUI version, so we aren't really in a position to file a bug report / support ticket.

I also could not find a suitable alternative library (there are multiple tree view libraries, though they either are accessible but don't support our use cases, or they do support our use cases but are not accessible).

The decision to use accordion pattern was also partially because of this.

</details>

## Notes

Aside from further cosmetic improvements, we will need to:
- Handle the disabled state in chapter level, module level, and block level
- Display the completion check mark next to chapter and module title

I'll create separate PRs for those to keep this PR in a reviewable size.

","Do we want the welcome block from Quincy to be it's own chapter?
Right now it is listed as a module, but maybe it works for it to be its own chapter ü§î  Yep, we can have the fCC introduction as a separate chapter.

I'll need your help with the chapter title, but I guess the structure would be:

```
[chapter - intro]
  [module - getting-started-with-freecodecamp]
    [block - lecture-welcome-to-freecodecamp]
[chapter - html]
[chapter - css]
...
``` I think intro works for the title and the structure looks good to me üëç  I added [that chapter here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/57151/files#diff-d5befb16f2e5667940f0cd15dba286e6a04c96343d8f6d2828e4f6332f0807a0R3) - I just called it `freecodecamp`, but I'm not sure that's the best. I'll update the PR to match yours. We can change that later if needed. We can totally build the accordion from scratch, but I decided to pull in the Disclosure component from HeadlessUI so help track the expanded/collapsed state.

I've created https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/ui/issues/419 to move it to the fcc/ui library. I previously wanted to indent the description a little, but the padding mismatch between different block types makes it difficult to keep the description of all blocks aligned (the padding values are set at different div level, so the overrides will be very messy).

So this is me giving up and just keep the description left-aligned with the block title. The indentation is very subtle anyway, so I think it doesn't make any difference with or without it. Make the chapter and module dropdown icons as large as the block icon. It's better to review this file with whitespace hidden. ```suggestion

I'll wait for #57138 go to in before making any changes to this line, to avoid conflicts. `useMemo` can help here, but currently it's not doing a lot. While `challenges` never changes, `chosenBlock` does and each time it does we recalculate a few things we don't need to.

So, rather than putting the whole thing in a memo, we can memoize just the parts that depend on challenges.

I'll push a commit in a bit so you can see what I'm getting at."

If two sibling elements have the same `z-index` and are both positioned absolutely using `position: absolute`, how do you determine which one is on top?
``` ```suggestion
In what way will the property `position: relative` exert an effect on sibling elements in regards to document flow?
``` ```suggestion
By default it behaves like `position: absolute` creating a new stacking context.
``` ```suggestion
The closest ancestor with `position: fixed`
```
We should just use ""with"" for all of them. I feel like these were all dissimilar for no reason. ```suggestion
The closest ancestor with `position: absolute`
``` ```suggestion
The closest ancestor with `position: relative`
``` ```suggestion
What would happen if a positioned element had `z-index: -1`?
```

Technically, nothing happens unless you set the position to something other than the default static, or it is a grid or flex item. So it feels like a trick question. Which we could switch it to as well by changing the correct answer. Not sure about this one. It is possible for elements to be behind a floated element.

If you look at the first example and remove the `clear: left` you can see the `p` element box is behind the floated elements, but its text still wraps around the floats.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear#clear_left ```suggestion
The surrounding elements ignore the floated element and overlap it.
```

It is a subtle distinction.

The first ""elements that ignore it"" implies (to me) an explicit state, and the second ""surrounding elements ignore"" is an implicit state caused by the floated element.

It is definitely possible for elements to overlap the floated element if they are ""ignoring it"", e.g. are positioned so they can overlap it. This is repeating a previous question (question 9 if I counted correctly - Line 196). ```suggestion
Which of the following CSS techniques is an accepted method for preventing a parent container from shrinking in size when it contains only floated elements?

It should be :
````
`th` elements in the first column should have the `class` of `time` and contain time values.

Once the root selector exists, the following assert is always satisfied. I thought it wouldn't because this is a custom property but the test passes without creating `--color0`. Sure thing.  ```suggestion

Yep, absolutely.This works well, but it shares a lot of code with the about page. Neither are entirely what we want, though - they're both rather verbose, when all we want is to make a query and see if it succeeds.

I do like the use of Promises, though, that makes life a lot easier. For instance, it lets us integrate with, say, React query, meaning we don't have to mess around with callbacks or effects.

Here's what I recommend (either in this PR or separately, ~doesn't matter~, actually it's kinda complex so another PR would be good):

1. convert these components to functions
2. move the image validation logic into its own module
3. use a data fetching library (the react docs have [recommendations](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#what-are-good-alternatives-to-data-fetching-in-effects)) to handle image validation requests.

Closes #49132

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","There doesn't seem to be a reason to use a callback. It's necessary if you want to do something based on the updated state, but this just updates it. ```suggestion
              onInput={this.createOnChangeHandler(id, 'image')}
```
Why was this changed from `onChange`? It fetches the image with the latest state.

```js
  void this.validateImageLoad(userInput).then(imageValidation => {
              this.setState({ isImageValid: imageValidation });
   });
```

It avoids changing the whole component with handling asynchronous values. onChange doesn't work with pasting well onInput does.

I can give it another look though. I don't believe that's how it works. The point of the callback is simply to deal with the fact that `this.state` does not change immediately after `this.setState` is called. e.g.

```
// this.state starts as { thing: false }
this.setState({ thing: true })
if (this.state.thing) {
 // this branch isn't reached because the state has not yet changed.
}
```

Since we don't care about the current state and the only use for the callback is when we _do_ care, this is misleading. Okay, that seems reasonable. Could you make it consistent, though? Whichever way makes the most sense, of course. Well the fact of the matter is that class components do not have a good way of dealing with specific state changes. We do hit the callback every time, but we only change the state when we care (like you said). Which is in my opinion a reasonable way to handle this.

Edit: But I see your point, I think. We are not using the updated state we are only making use of the user input. Which makes the callback misleading. 
  If you're planning to migrate this to a functional component soon, then we don't need to worry about this. It's not broken, after all!"

``` This would work better as design a Greeting Card.
We will also want to change that in all places.  

```suggestion
In this workshop, you will practice working with different pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements by designing a greeting card. The HTML boilerplate has been provided for you. 

Start the workshop by linking the `styles.css` file.
``` I feel like this would work better as two tests.
One to make sure they added the class. Another to make sure they added the id I think we need to be more explicit then `p.message`.

```suggestion
Inside the `div` element, add an `h1` with the text `Happy Birthday!`. Then add a paragraph element with a `class` called `message` and the text `Wishing you all the happiness and joy on your special day!`.
``` ```suggestion
Now it is time to style your greeting card.
``` ```suggestion
The first one should have a text of `Send Card`, a `class` of `send-link` and an `href` of `#send`.
``` ```suggestion
The first one should have a text of `Share on Social Media`, a `class` of `share-link` and an `href` of `#share`.
``` ```suggestion
The second `a` element should have an `href` with a value of `#share`.
``` ```suggestion
The first `a` element should have an `href` with a value of `#send`.
``` ```suggestion
Add a new selector that changes the `background-color` of the `.card` element to `khaki` when it is hovered over.
``` It looks like `transform` was briefly mentioned at the end of the pseudo elements script.
But it wouldn't hurt to have an explanation with a code snippet here to as a reminder since it only came up once and they might have forgotten. 

 Same here. Even though `transition` was briefly mentioned in the last lecture video, lets add a short reminder note here about how this code is working.  Flexbox hasn't been taught yet. So we will need to add a brief explanation to what flexbox is and talk about what justify content and space-around does. Then mention they will learn more about flexbox in a future module.  ```suggestion
Add the selector with the `pseudo-class` to target the `.card-links a` elements when hovered.
``` It doesn't like the `skewX(10deg)` value has been taught yet.

Add a short sentence before this explaining what it is with a short code snippet.  ````suggestion

This is not allowed I guess there's something wrong here:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72281fe3-1c6b-448c-b06a-395fdb1bf43d)
 ```suggestion
  background-color: khaki;
```

Typo found.  ```suggestion
You should have two `section` elements.
``` ```suggestion
The first `section` should have an `id` of `send`.
``` ```suggestion
The second `section` should have an `id` of `share`.
``` ```suggestion
The `transform` property can transform the element look. For example, giving it a value of `scale(0.9)` would make the element 10% smaller.
``` ```suggestion
Add a `transform` property to the `.card:hover` selector and set to `scale(1.1)`.
``` ```suggestion
The `.card:hover` selector should have `transform: scale(1.1)`.
``` ```suggestion
If a value is omitted, like the timing for the first property, a default value is applied.
``` Not able to pass this test. Here's the value I got: `transform 0.3s, background-color 0.3s` ```suggestion
Create a pseudo-class selector that targets the `.card-links a` elements when hovered over.
```
Not sure but it sounds better to me ```suggestion
Add a `transition` property to the `.card-links a` selector and give it a value of `background-color 0.3s ease`.

Due to the slight hassle of testing multiple challenge files in a row, I made a bash script intended to make things a little easier. With this, the script gets ran and challenge testers can enter the ids of the challenges that need to be tested separated by commas. 

I'm fairly sure that while the script use is niche (intended for challenges like the full stack cert ones) , it fills a gap. ",

Currently the conditional rendering of the searchbar and searchbar-optimized is not behaving as desired. If you go to production. Type in the optimized search bar (the one that doesn't show a list of results) click on one of the curriculum buttons. Try to type. See that it is still using the optimized search bar instead of the default one (the one which shows a list of results).

This fixes that by using the provided pathname by Gatsby. Which updates accordingly. 

The path name we used was not updated every time we navigated somewhere else because there was no reason to re-render the component.

","Rather than looking for the absence of something and waiting arbitrarily, how about waiting for the non-optimized search bar to appear? i.e. add `search-unoptimized` to the other search component and look for that. ```suggestion
```
The test looks fine, but I don't think we need it. Basically because if this test failed, we wouldn't mind. The un-optimised search bar delivers a better UX, so if they see it when navigating back that's fine. ```suggestion
  const search = isLanding(pathname) ? (
```
since we're not using window, we don't have to check it exists. ```suggestion
    <SearchBarOptimized innerRef={searchBarRef} />
  ) : (

  );

Companion to https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56808. It adds all the layouts according to which combination of `isProjectBased` and `isGridBased` that they have. The rationale being that it's confusing (to me!) to have some block's layout determined by the `blockLayout` properties while some rely on `isProjectBased` and `isGridBased`.

 The logic for how they currently determine `blockLayout` is here

```suggestion

---
For FSD, we are using the new `link` type for the block layout. 

I think the A2 English exam block could be rendered as a link as well. Though, I can't guarantee that it's safe to use the `link` type outside of the FSD super block (at least at the moment, when we are still making changes to the block display). 

The next option is the `legacy-link` type, but this type also renders a tag that reads ""Certification Project"", which could be confusing since there are no projects in English certs.

I think we can just use the `project-list` type for now and update it later, at least it's consistent with the C# exam. ```suggestion
  ""blockLayout"": ""legacy-challenge-grid""

- When `jscustom.input` time outs `pyodide.ffi.JsException` is raised. Or breaks in different ways too, I guess, locally I was getting different specific error than in production.
- I'm not sure how to force keyboard interrupt in the fCC's terminal, `Ctrl + C` doesn't seem to do anything for me. I'm right now assuming, it still would be `pyodide.ffi.JsException` raised in such case, as it happens in the JS _code_.
- I've tried to use custom `signal.SIGINT` handler, to handle all `KeyboardInterrupt`s. It was only partially working, as it actually required the literal keyboard interrupt, not `KeyboardInterrupt` raised by code. In the latter case handler would not be executed.
- _interrupt_ is not very precise right now. Execution still continues further, once terminal is cleared.

What happens step-by-step:
1. `input` time outs, `pyodide.ffi.JsException` is raised.
1. Exception is handled by the code wrapped around `input` function. `jscustom.__interruptExecution` sends `reset` message.
1. Terminal is reset. No duplicated inputs.
1. Exception is re-raised to be handled (or not) by user code.",

Corrected words that apparently are mistakes:
- Step 38: ""following example"" -> ""example above""
- Step 99: ""in the inventory"" -> ""in the `weapons` array""
- Step 117: ""the value of `monsters[fighting]""` -> ""the value of the `health` property of `monsters[fighting]`""
- Step 157: The test is saying not to modify the existing `if` statement, but the step is actually asking to add another condition to the if statement. So I changed it to say not to modify the existing ""condition"".

Added/removed code tags:
- Step 49, 54, 150, 169

Added quotes around string values:
- Step 120, 155
","This isn't from your change, but I have a nit here :smile:

We are using the pattern `the string ""X""` rather than `the ""X"" string` in other hints, so I think this one should be updated to follow the pattern.

You should use the concatenation operator to add the value of `monsters[fighting].name` to the string `""The ""`.

So for example, where it says `You should use const` we should allow any valid answer like let, const or even var.
The only time we should care is if they need to reassign a value, then we should test for let.

As for accessing elements for the DOM, they should be able to use `getElementById` or `querySelector`. We shouldn't need to specifically test for `getElementById`. We should only test for the final result. How they go about it is up to them.

So for example, where it says `You should use const` we should allow any valid answer like let, const or even var.
The only time we should care is if they need to reassign a value, then we should test for let.

As for accessing elements for the DOM, they should be able to use `getElementById` or `querySelector`. We shouldn't need to specifically test for `getElementById`. We should only test for the final result. How they go about it is up to them.

When you click your `checkMessageButton` you should only alert the user if `messageInput` is empty.

it works either way but double negation is confusing this doesn't match, you need two spaces in the string to be matched by this regex.
 I'm just going to remove this test. In the following step, it's mentioned that this won't match `10 dollars`. So it shouldn't be an issue. Seems reasonable! ```suggestion
Update your `isSpam()` function to use the `.test()` method on `helpRegex` to test if `msg` is a match.
``` ```suggestion
Update the `isSpam()` function to use the `some()` method, which will check if testing `msg` against any of the regular expressions in `denyList` returns `true`."" 
``` ```suggestion
Arrays have a `some()` method. Like the `filter()` method, `some()` accepts a callback function which should take an element of the array as the argument. The `some()` method will return `true` if the callback function returns `true` for at least one element in the array.

The `transform-origin` property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is applied. For example, when you apply a `rotate` transformation (as you'll do later in this project), the `transform-origin` determines around which point the element is rotated.
``` ```suggestion
Give the `.line` selector a `transform-origin` property of `0% 0%`. This will offset the origin point at `0%` from the left and `0%` from the top, setting it to the top left corner of the element.

There is an inconsistency in the FSD display in that some blocks have their intro immediately present on the screen, while others keep the intro in the accordion panel, which only show when the accordion is expanded.

I think we should have the intro displayed at all times because the block titles are now just ""Build X"", rather than ""Learn X by building Y"".

","We are using `ChallengeGridBlock` for both the existing grid-based blocks and FSD grid-based blocks, and I'm only applying the change to FSD blocks, so the `showIntroInBlockHeader` flag is needed. 

But I'm very uncomfortable with this change as the code is too messy.

I think we should either clone `ChallengeGridBlock`, too, just like what we did with `LegacyLinkBlock` and `LegacyChallengeListBlock`. Or we apply the change to all grid-based blocks and remove the `showIntroInBlockHeader` flag. <details>

It'll need formatting as well :( The meta will need updating so that the old challenges aren't messed up when LegacyChallengeGridBlock and ChallengeGridBlock diverge. Just to be sure, by ""meta"", did you mean the `meta.json` files or something else?

Since campers are not supposed to copy the demo I suppose it's fine have some extra functionalities there. If we prefer to not have that, for whatever reason, we can remove paragraphs from it.

Otherwise we could add more user stories to include paragraphs. I'd be happy to write more tests for those in case we agree that they should be able to convert them.

In any case, for the way tests are written, there shouldn't be any issues other than the mismatch between the output mentioned in the hint `<strong>...</strong>` and the one obtained from the demo `<p><strong>...</strong></p>`. The tests ran fine with different solutions üëçÔ∏è @moT01 I made some changes but I'm not sure how much I should explain about the markdown syntax.
Do you think that it would be better to convert each table row into a user story and add more info in each? A PR has been merged that renamed the certification from ""Front End"" to ""Full Stack"". This PR may need an update and a few changes made: [see comment](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56694#issuecomment-2444473378) A PR has been merged that [moves the block order from the `meta.json` file to the `full-stack.json` file.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56795) This PR will need an update, and the order will need to be removed from the `meta.json` file and moved to the new file. I hope you don't mind @Dario-DC, I went ahead and updated this and made those fixes. Also, I am not able to pass any of the tests due to these errors in the console:

`input` is defined in `--after-user-code--` so I guess the html is not linked to the script.js. Let me know if that is not the case @zairahira  I have ensured that the `script.js` is linked properly but I am still getting this error. I am using Chrome.

 @ilenia-magoni caould you give this PR a review? I am running into some strange issues. It works for me, I don't get the `input` is not defined if I copy the solution code @zairahira  Thanks for confirming that @ilenia-magoni üëçÔ∏èFirst fast check, found a couple of things to fix Took a quick look, here are some suggestions:

- At the start, you should mention that the html and css has been provided for you like you mentioned in the book mark manager lab.

- For consistency, you should add this at the end of the user stories:

```
**Note:** Be sure to link your JavaScript file in your HTML.
```

Also, I noticed the raw HTML has extra `p` tags as shown below. It makes sense that text would be in a `p`, it just doesn't match what the table is expecting you to convert.

 This is pretty awesome @Dario-DC üéâ A have a few concerns...

Will it be clear that users are supposed to use regex here? Maybe we should add a user story (or in the description) to ""use regular expressions to convert the markdown into HTML"" - to give just a little more guidance.

Not necessary, but it would be cool if there was a second output that showed the rendered HTML. Here's my (very old) [markdown project](https://codepen.io/moT01/pen/egrZzr) that has a second output. I was thinking something like that - or potentially just add it to the demo as a bonus thing for users to try and do if they choose.

My biggest concern is that I'm not sure people will know the markdown syntax to be able to create the regex's. I'm guessing that we don't teach it anywhere. For instance, a markdown heading only works when the `#`'s are at the start of a line, with zero or more spaces in front, and at least one space after - e.g: `^\s*#\s+`. A lot of the other things have similar nuances. I think we might need to add an explanation about all those nuances or I don't think people will know how to solve this. There are tests for certain things like ""`some text # title 1` should not convert `# title 1` into an `h1` element."" which helps - but if that fails, I don't think people will know what they're supposed to do to fix it or why it shouldn't turn it into an `h1`. Perhaps a third column in that table with notes - not really sure.

I did try at first to pass this using a markdown library to convert it for me üòà  - wasn't quite able to get it to work, cause it didn't convert things exactly the same. Wonder if we should try and block that somehow. Maybe a ""You should only have one script element"" test. Not necessary to add this, I think it's fine - just mentioning it.

This is mostly a refactor, but the functional change is that now the TS worker tries to setup TS during the initial execution of the worker script. It doesn't wait for the client to ask it to initialize. In practical terms this makes very little difference since the client executes `new Worker...` and `worker.postMessage` in quick succession, but I think it's a bit cleaner.

This is based off of https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/54133 because I wanted to use top-level await

Without this, Prisma attempts to delete the user, sees that this would break referential integrity and throws an error.

The other way to avoid the issue was to make the relation optional, i.e. allow exam attempts to exist without a corresponding user, but @ShaunSHamilton confirmed that this is not what's desired.

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","Asking to be sure, is this removal accidental or intentional?

It looks to me `WithInstantSearch` already handles the query update (it does call `updateSearchQuery`) so we don't need to call the function here.

If the removal is intentional, we should also clean up the import on line 18. Yes, this was fully intentional!  I'm assuming this removal is because the current version is not working?

These code map to the `s` and `/` keys, but I tested on production and they aren't working (`s` does nothing, and `/` triggers the search-on-page feature on Firefox). I'm wondering if we could just keep the search function as a noop. I'm just not sure about having the function return mock data in production code :/ Well if I understand correctly, the production build will fail if there are no Algolia Keys present. This ""Hack"" is not entirely for testing purposes only. It gracefully handles Algolia failing to search it's hits. 

If we do not have this functionality, Gatsby will tell us that react-instantsearch (or whichever of the dozen packages that are included now) that it can't iterate or splice on an empty results/hit array. ```suggestion
      url: noHits ? '' : `${searchUrl}?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`,
```
url can't be null. ```suggestion
          matchLevel: 'none' as const,
```
`string` isn't compatible with `Hit` ```suggestion
  ]
```
It shouldn't be necessary. I'm not sure why, but this no longer highlights on hover."

The doctype isn't missing in the written code. For example in step 9 of the challenge linked to in the issue a doctype is already in the HTML that was written.

I just think all our previews are missing the doctype no matter what.

---

Not sure, but `write()` wipes out any previous content, so maybe the frame has a doctype before the write?

It happens in the MDN example as well for write. Their iframe for the example code output starts out with a doctype and after you click the button it is missing.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write

 I do get what you are saying. _If_ the camper had missed adding the doctype we would be fixing that. I'm just not sure what else to do. The iframe has to have a doctype and it doesn't get one even if it was added to the HTML in the editor. Yep, that's all correct, to my understanding.

There's a couple of gotchas, but, in short, my fix was to prefix the content with `<!DOCTYPE html>` when the camper has added it. When I tried it, I ended up calling `frame.write(includeDoctype ? '<!DOCTYPE html>' + content : content);` (more or less). `includeDoctype`'s value was conditional on the presence or absence of the doctype, unsurprisingly.

I didn't want to just submit another PR, though, since yours is better than what we have _and_ you figured out what the underlying issue was! @ojeytonwilliams How and where are you checking for the doctype?

I moved the code to `writeContentToFrame` and pass `writeToFrame` the doctype if I find it in the `sources.contents`.My approach was a bit more convoluted, because I'd forgotten that the sources retain the original `<!DOCTYPE html>`, if present. I like your approach a lot more!","My approach was a bit more convoluted, because I'd forgotten that the sources retain the original `<!DOCTYPE html>`, if present.

That's because I removed the completion modal üòÖ I probably stared at this for so long, and got annoyed by the fact that I'd get two popups if I pass the quiz (confirm finish and completion modals) compared to just one if I fail the quiz (only the confirm finish modal).

I just added the modal back.

---

I have created #56790 for the quiz description change, and https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/ui/issues/397 for the `passingGrade` variable rename. Hey, @huyenltnguyen, I'll finish my review soon, but to explain: passing the deps to `usePageLeave` seemed like it would be a maintenance headache, since it required us to figure out exactly what `usePageLeave`'s effect really depended on. Wrapping the functions in `useCallback` means that the linter can find any missing deps and we don't have to. Hey Oliver, it's intentional that the quiz is locked after the camper has submitted, regardless of whether or not they pass or fail the quiz. At the moment, the `hasSubmitted` state is saved in the client, but there will be a follow-up PR to record the attempt in the DB. It's so that we can enforce the cool-down period and nudge the camper to revisit the lessons.

More details can be found here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/fCC10/issues/2#issuecomment-2391462203. Perfect, thanks for the clarification.This is looking good @huyenltnguyen üéâ I mentioned below that we should set the passing percent to 85%. Other than that, I would be fine merging this. A couple other things I noticed...

This isn't using the space from the component library - so it might conflict with that other PR.

I don't get any feedback when I pass the quiz. Like a celebratory modal or anything.

No need to fix either of those here.  Yea, it's a little weird with the modal, but I think it's better - lets them know that they passed.

The spacer is still used in the two modal components. Hey @huyenltnguyen I pushed a small refactor, I hope that's okay.

Just one question: is it placeholder behaviour that the quiz locks after failure? If this is not intended to be the final UX, it's all good.","This is looking good @huyenltnguyen üéâ I mentioned below that we should set the passing percent to 85%.

This PR:
- Adds `passingGrade` to quiz
- Adds a `usePageLeave` hook to subscribe to the page close and page change events
- Updates the quiz workflow to handle the finish and exit actions
- Adds tests for the quiz challenge since its behaviors are now a little too complex to keep track of

The workflow is now as follows:
- If campers refresh, click the back button, or click on any link on the page
  - The action is blocked, and a confirm dialog would show up
- If campers have not answered all questions
  - Clicking the Finish button would show a list of unanswered questions
- If campers have answered all questions
  - Clicking the Finish button would show a confirm modal,
  - Clicking the Finish button on the modal would close the modal and show the quiz result
    - If campers meet the passing grade
      - The quiz is disabled
      - The Finish button would change to ""Submit and go""
    - If campers don't meet the passing grade
      - The quiz is disabled
      - The Finish button would be disabled

","I'm keeping this as a custom hook as I think we could reuse it for https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/54796#issuecomment-2307687736. (The catch is, that component needs to be a function component.) We now have a confirm finish modal. So campers would get the confirm finish modal, then immediately the completion modal if they pass the quiz.

I'm removing the completion modal to reduce the amount of popups users have to see. Not sure if we have agreed on the passing grade. I'm temporary having it at 80%. I think the handlers are quite... confusing, so translation:
- We have two buttons: Finish quiz and Exit quiz
- The handlers of the buttons are `handleFinishQuiz` and `handleExitQuiz`
- Both handlers trigger their corresponding modal. But `handleFinishQuiz` has some additional logic to determine whether the modal should be triggered
- The finish and exit modals have a primary button that handles the finish and exit actions
- The handlers of the buttons are `handleFinishQuizModalBtnClick` and `handleExitQuizModalBtnClick` (the mouthful names are my attempt to differentiate them from the other handlers üòÖ ) The exit button (on the modal) would take campers to another page (`navigate(blockHashSlug)`). 

However, we have `usePageLeave` listening to all route change events, so it would block the navigation from happening, and displays yet another popup.

I use the `exitConfirmed` state as a flag to bypass the hook. The value is `true` when the exit button is clicked. This test suite is not complete. 

It's not covering the full quiz completion flow yet (when campers failed / passed the quiz). Those test cases would require https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/ui/pull/390, so I'll raise a follow-up PR for them. The quiz challenges all say ""Answer all of the questions below correctly to pass the quiz."" So those would need to be updated if we go this route. We haven't settled on anything. Let me get back to you on this.

Pretty minor, but the variable name could be changed to `passingPercent` - seems slightly more clear to me, but not necessary to change. ```suggestion
    passingGrade: 85,
```

Lets change this to 85. So they can get up to three wrong and pass.

I'm fine with it like this for now, but we could maybe set this in the challenge frontmatter, so each quiz can have it's own passing percent. No need to change it yet though, our quizzes all have the same structure for now. ```suggestion
const mapStateToProps = (state: unknown) => ({
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment, @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call
  isExitQuizModalOpen: isExitQuizModalOpenSelector(state)
});
```
We do this all over the place, but `createSelector` creates a memoized selector. If we're not computing anything, we don't need to memoize, it just creates an extra layer of abstraction. ```suggestion
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  closeExitQuizModal: () => closeModal('exitQuiz')
};
```
Same thing, but [less cruft](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch#defining-mapdispatchtoprops-as-an-object). ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
const mapStateToProps = (state: unknown) => ({
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment, @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call
  isExitQuizModalOpen: isExitQuizModalOpenSelector(state)
});
``` ```suggestion
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  closeExitQuizModal: () => closeModal('exitQuiz')
};
``` Just an aside, but this is effectively ""skip(() => true)"", since we never test upcoming changes in e2e tests.

At some point soonish it would be good if we could run tests against both, but I'm not sure how best to achieve that. We want to avoid just running all the tests again, but with `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES=true`, since it just takes too long. Why is this so slow? The purpose of this condition is to allow the tests to pass CI.

CI has `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES` set to false, so the new challenges aren't available, causing the tests to fail. I initially went with `test.skip(process.env.CI === 'true')`, but this condition doesn't cover the case where we have `SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES=false` in local environment (and the tests would fail if we run them locally). So `process.env.SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES !== 'true'` is the most accurate condition I could think of.

I'm also wondering if we could have an environment variable specific to the FSD curriculum, say `IS_FSD_LIVE` or something like that. I think we'll need a feature flag of some sorts to allow the development of the major changes (reorganizing the curriculum list, marking some super blocks as legacy, adding expiration date to certs, etc.). I'm not sure why, but the page load alone took almost 20 seconds to finish when I wrote the tests.

I just tried again (and after I restarted my computer) and the completion is much faster now. I see what you're saying. We do need a way to test this stuff, otherwise it'll just be a source of false confidence. However, precisely how we should do that isn't obvious to me. Perhaps we need a separate set of tests that run against the upcoming build. It would probably mean wasting a bit more time in CI building both versions of the client, but once the new api is in we can get rid of a few workflows. We should be able to handle the extra build time."

Followup to https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56752, this time extending the generic component to handle multiple choice questions.

The only other thing I did was remove extra css imports. Since css is bundled together and used everywhere, there's no need to import a given file more than once.



Edit from Tom:

This also removes the odin show component in favor of the generic one. The odin challenges and college algrebra challenges are the only ones I see that were using it. There is one significant difference with using the generic component - it moves the challenge title and description to above the video. Which I think is fine. The college algebra descriptions are quite short, I think they're fine. The odin descriptions are a little longer:

","Just looking at it, it's an absolute monster of a check. I swear we should probably have a helper to make sure the elements are present but not necessarily in the same order as we expect.  Yeah, it's a monster. And regex tests should be replaced when possible. I think we agreed on doing it in 2025 for a matter of time. I have a silly question. How much of my initial function need to be modified to take care of a forEach statement instead of a function? https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/curriculum-helpers/blob/main/lib/__tests__/javascript-helper.test.ts I'm not sure, but considering that the forEach can be chained to something of variable structure it could be a mess.

>  https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/curriculum-helpers/blob/main/lib/__tests__/javascript-helper.test.ts

Do we use these anywhere? Could we try to capture parameters of the callback, then sort them and compare with array having parameters ordered? I actually don't think we will need that helper in this case, because these steps are broken down to much. I understand why that was in the current context. But for the new curriculum, it won't need to be broken down to this extent. 

In the future refactor PR's, we will probably just have one step to create the initial `displayAuthors` function where the author container is updated with this user card div

```js
 <div id=""${index}"" class=""user-card"">
      <h2 class=""author-name"">${author}</h2>
 </div>
``` 

Campers will have a much more solid foundation before they reach this project, so a lot of these steps will be more opened ended similar to labs, and it will be 10X easier to test because we will testing the final result instead of using all of this regex.

But for now, we can just merge this project as is because it is stable enough to go in.
Then we can worry about refactors in future PR's.

Even the most hardcode campers won't reach this project until maybe Feburary. (if that). Most won't reach it until, halfway through the year because of the way the new curriculum is setup.  The refactors will be added in by then. So it all works out üëç  I made an issue about that helper so I don't forget. I am also looking forward to those refactors. "

 This checks failing seem to be coming from another file navigation-from-last-challenge.spec.ts:61:7 on chromium and chrome 
Is that an issue ? Hi, @Othniel01, thanks for updating the PR. It looks like the style element is causing another test to fail. Once that's addressed, this should be good to go. Thank you @ojeytonwilliams @naomi-lgbt 
Please let me know in any way I can be of more help, as I am learning a lot from this contribution. Thanks for the offer, @Othniel01. If you have a chance to look into the failing test, that would be a big help. <h1> Reason for test failure </h1>
@ojeytonwilliams After taking time to review the failing test, seems the test failing is related to the check for a solution in the ""learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app"" challenge from the ""2022/responsive-web-design"" super block.
Our injected code is making this test to fail, as the test is meant to check if any extensions are in use
<br></br>
<b>""You appear to be using a browser extension that is modifying the page. Be sure to turn off all browser extensions""</b>
<br></br>
and this is meant to return a value of +0 if successful but we are getting -1. 
<br></br>
The test framework might have detected our style injection modification and flagged the solution as invalid, even though the solution itself might be correct. 
<br></br>
Now we have added a csshelper class earlier that is meant to make the tests ignore our style element, but it seems not all of them ignore the style injection. 
<br></br>
Also checking the superblock with  ID: 5dc174fcf86c76b9248c6eb2
<br></br>
Im unsure about this but likely I feel the issue we're encountering with the message that suggests a browser extension is modifying the page is most likely related to the last set of assertions with the challenge's hints. 
<br></br>
assert.isAtMost(document.querySelectorAll('script').length, 2);
<br></br>
assert.equal(document.querySelectorAll('style').length, 0);
<br></br>
assert.equal(document.querySelectorAll('link').length, 0);
<br></br>
For <style> tag: The test expects document.querySelectorAll('style').length to equal 0, but our code is injecting a <style> tag, causing our tests to fail.

<h1>Possible Solutions </h1>

Could we still find another way to modify the tests to ignore <style> tags that have a specific class or attribute, such as we did with the fcc-hide-header. This way, our injected styles are not counted by the test. 

OR

To conditionally inject the <style> tag based on the environment, to skip the injection during tests.
 That sounds right. It should be sufficient to adjust the test so that it checks that there is one style element (the one added in this PR). If it's anything other than 1, it's likely that an extension has added more. <h1>Reverted Pull Request Changes</h1>
@ojeytonwilliams  Now in all the versions from english to ukrainian
<br></br>
Sorry how do we then set the length to 1, is there another way to make the change?  to give room for our injected style element, any other style element asides from this would trigger this error as an extension is in use.
<br></br>
<b>assert.equal(document.querySelectorAll('style').length, 1);</b>
<br></br>
Hopefully this stops the errors. Sorry, I think we might be talking about different things.

The problem was that you'd changed the i18n curriculum. That was the only change that needed reverting.

Could you restore the fixes you had made to the curriculum files? Okay restored back the curriculum changes and left the  i18n curriculum folder alone @ojeytonwilliams  Seems like we are resolving the failing tests a step at a time, the new failing test stems from the ""2022/responsive-web-design"" curriculum while working on the ""learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu"" block, specifically for ""Step 12.""

""You should not add a new <style> tag. Add the new CSS rules to the existing <style> tag.""

The error indicates that our code did not meet the test requirements, which expected us to modify an existing <style> tag rather than create a new one.

 This is the code responsible for checking if there are more than 1 style sheets added or being used at the ""2022/responsive-web-design"" curriculum while working on the ""learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu"" block, specifically for ""Step 12.""

const hasManyStyleTags = document.querySelectorAll('style').length > 1;
assert(!hasManyStyleTags);


Since we are injecting a style sheet globally, we can increase the number to 2

const hasManyStyleTags = document.querySelectorAll('style').length > 2;
assert(!hasManyStyleTags);

Allowing for our injected style script and the given style script and not more than two. any other style added would now throw the error ignoring our injected style sheet Hey @ojeytonwilliams, thanks for your feedback, I would be waiting for any updates concerning this issue
 there are merge conflicts now hope the merge conflicts have been resolved now there are still challenges failing for the new style, @ojeytonwilliams do you have updates? Sorry for the delay. I pushed a couple of minor changes to fix the failing tests and it should be fine now. Maybe you should update the branch to be on pair with main, to be sure that none of the more recent changes is a conflict with the changes you made @ilenia-magoni it shouldn't be necessary. Every time you push a new commit to GitHub, it implicitly rebases the entire branch on top of the target, main in this case. I did not mean merge conflicts, I meant to see if new challenges have issues, or things like that Right, but that's what just happened. When I pushed my commit, GitHub rebased this PR's commits on top of main, before triggering the actions. Any new challenges that were in main at the point I pushed will have been included in the CI tests.I'm afraid this is a problem - it's no longer possible to pass the tests for the Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project.

What's happening is that the library we use to analyse the learner's code (style code in this case) is detecting the new style element introduced by this PR.

The bigger problem is that we have a battery of tests that should have detected this, but they didn't. I'll look into that now, since we need those to work to prevent regressions. Thanks for updating those tests. Could you revert the wanted changes, then we can try CI again? Hi, @Othniel01 I'm afraid there are more tests that were written assuming there would be one style element.

At a glance they seem to be quite brittle, so it's possible there are better ways to write them. I'll ask someone on the curriculum team to advise. Thanks for your patience, @Othniel01. This LGTM :+1: ","I'm afraid this is a problem - it's no longer possible to pass the tests for the Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project.

This pull request introduces enhancements to the createHeader function, which now injects CSS to ensure that specific head elements (including title, meta, link, and script tags) are hidden in the preview frame. This change addresses a previously identified issue where these elements were being rendered in the preview, potentially causing confusion for users.

Created a jest test file and ran a test to ensure that the css to hide head elements and scripts is being injected, here is a screenshot below

Now when adding css to the javascript and algorithm data structure beta, the scripts texts from head and body arent rendered anymore in preview

![haq](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/770153ca-0441-4b4c-9e24-91b17540833d)


","First, this file doesn't seem to be in the right directory. Or any directory.

Second, I think rather than testing we inject the content, we should have an E2E test which enters the CSS that triggers the issue into the editor, and confirm that the preview window does not contain content. Okay I was having a hard time finding the editor element so I can insert the script into it.
This is the code in the newly created E2e test,  e2e/iframe-script.spec.ts

import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';
import translations from '../client/i18n/locales/english/translations.json';
import { focusEditor } from './utils/editor';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(
    '/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-cash-register-project/build-a-cash-register'
  );
});

test.describe('Challenge Preview Component', () => {
  // Test for inserting <style> tag and checking if the preview is empty
  test('should render an empty preview after inserting CSS', async ({
    page,
    isMobile
  }) => {
    await focusEditor({ page, isMobile });

    // Insert the <style> tag with display: block rule into the editor
    const styleTag = `
      <style>
      * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: block;
      }
      </style>`;
    await page.keyboard.insertText(styleTag);

    if (isMobile) {
      await page
        .getByRole('tab', { name: translations.learn['editor-tabs'].preview })
        .click();
    }

    // Check that the iframe preview is empty
    const frame = page.frameLocator('#fcc-main-frame').first();

    // Make sure there are no visible elements inside the iframe's body
    await expect(frame.locator('body')).toBeEmpty();
  });
});
 The E2E test covers this change. This file should be removed. The e2e/iframe-script.spec.ts has been removed. If im understanding you correctly there is already another E2E test to cover this change.

hosting locally, using the problematic css does not bring up the unwanted scripts any more.

 ```suggestion
  <style class=""fcc-hide-header"">
```
The CSSHelper class ignores `style` elements with classes, so this should fix those bugs. However, this is a bit of a hack, so let's wait until https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56598 is in before we test this.

Assuming that this does the job, an explanatory comment (on line 87 or so) would help since it's far from obvious what this is doing. If this makes the style scripts ignored by the library, then for now this should be a temporal workaround preventing the unexpected rendering behavior in the test environments. Header PR has been approved, can we test this ? Sure. I've set the tests going. 1 failing

","I am concerned that the explanation for `tabindex` is giving the wrong impression and encouraging improper use. Basically, you should never use `tabindex` to specify the order that elements should receive focus (in other words, you should never use a `tabindex` value greater than `0`). The order that elements should receive focus should be determined by their position in the DOM (the natural tab order). Messing with that order does not help, but rather hinders  navigation.

The two legit uses for `tabindex`:
 
- Use `tabindex=0` to add an element to the natural tab order. There are primarily two reasons you would need to do this: 1) You are using an element that can't receive keyboard focus by default, such as using a `div` with `role=""button""` instead of using a `button` element and 2) there are rare cases where you need to make something focusable that normally wouldn't need to be, for example, enabling keyboard users to scroll overflowing containers because Chrome and Safari still don't allow this by default.
- Add `tabindex=""-1""` to an element to allow it to receive programmatic focus (this does not place it in the natural tab order). This is used in a variety of situations for ""focus management"", such as when you need to set the focus on a heading, error message, or dialog, or you are building custom components such as tabbing interfaces or tree components.

The main thing I would stress is that you should never use a `tabindex` value greater than `0` (which leaves just `0` and `-1`) and that the natural tab order should be determined by the elements position in the DOM.  Just a suggestion, I think you are leaving out by far the most popular automated accessibility testing tool, [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/). In fact, that's what Lighthouse uses underneath the hood to do its testing. And it is also works in all browsers. ```suggestion
- **`aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` attributes**: These attributes are used to give an element a programmatic (or accessible) name, which helps people using assistive technology (such as screen readers) understand the purpose of the element. They are often used when the visual label for an element is an image or symbol rather than text. `aria-label` allows you to define the name directly in the attribute while `aria-labelledby` allows you to reference existing text on the page.
```

Some suggestions on how to make it a little clearer that these two attributes do the exact same thing, just in a slightly different way.
 ```suggestion
- **`aria-expanded` attribute**: Used to convey the state of a toggle (or disclosure) feature to screen reader users.
```

This attribute is always confusing because it goes on the control element but it is describing the state of the element it is controlling. Seems clearer to just refer to both of these elements at the same time as a ""toggle"". ```suggestion
- **`aria-live` attribute**: Used to indicate that an element's content is important enough to require that any changes to the content should be announced immediately to screen reader users. This can include status messages like updating the number of results returned from a search, or an error message displayed after an unsuccessful form submission.
```

Just being picky here. I didn't like that `aria-live` was being defined with the word ""live"".  Because I can't help it :smile: In a perfect world, there would never be the need to use `role=""button""` because you would always use the `button` element instead. CSS is good enough nowadays that the arguments over being difficult to style a button are gone. The role of `dialog` is also going the same way now that the `dialog` element has full support in all browsers and is accessible out of the box. And of course the `nav` element has been around for a long time.

 If you want to humor me, you could use `role=""tab"", role=""menu"", and role=""alert""` instead. These are all roles that don't have HTML equivalents. But I'm not insisting on it. ```suggestion
- **`aria-hidden` attribute**: Used to hide an element from assistive technology such as screen readers. For example, this can be used to hide decorative images that do not provide any meaningful content.
```

Pure semantics here. While this is primarily used to hide content from screen reader users, it will also hide it from other types of assistive technology, basically anything that uses the accessibility tree API to communicate the contents on the page. If you think this distinction is too much or unnecessary, then I suggest it be changed to the following:

""Used to hide an element from screen reader users. For example, this can be used to hide decorative images that do not provide any meaningful content.""

 I pulled this list of tools from the existing tools mention in the lectures. We could add the `axe DevTools` to the list but we will need to add a section for that in the corresponding lecture script.  It looks like the videos for this lecture block haven't been recorded yet, so I will need to alert the person recording this about this change Ya, no worries. I figured this list was dependent upon was was being taught. I just wanted to mention it because axe is by far the most popular tool for accessibility testing and nobody I know in accessibility uses Lighthouse.

@jdwilkin4, a bit off topic, I apologize, but is it possible to review the lecture scripts for this? I am looking at the associated lecture script and it looks like quite a few roles were mentioned. So we can update this review page to the three you mentioned.  Absolutely!

If you want to message me your email through private message on the forum or discord, I can send you the actual scripts copied to a Google doc so you can leave notes/or edit the copies directly. Then we can update the actual scripts.

The person recording the accessibility videos has been notified to hold off on recording these set of videos

I will give you list for the HTML and Accessibility lecture block as well as the CSS and Accessibility lecture block  ```suggestion
- **Proper heading level structure**: You should use proper heading levels to create a logical structure for your content. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of your website.
```

I apologize for being so picky here. I just want to add the emphasis that this helps people, not technology. ```suggestion
- **Accessibility and Tables**: When using tables, you should use the `<th>` element to define header cells and the `<td>` element to define data cells. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure of the table.
```

Again, sorry for the last minute suggestions. ```suggestion
- **Importance for inputs to have an associated label**: You should use the `<label>` element to associate labels with form inputs. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the purpose of the input.
``` ```suggestion
- **Importance of good `alt` text**: You should use the `alt` attribute to provide a text alternative for images. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the image.
``` ```suggestion
- **Importance of good link text**: You should use descriptive link text to help users understand the purpose of the link. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the purpose of the link.
``` ```suggestion
- **`tabindex` attribute**: used to make elements focusable and define the relative order in which they should be navigated using the keyboard. It is important to never use the `tabindex` attribute with a value greater than 0. Instead, you should either use a value of 0 or -1. For more information, review the prior lecture video on keyboard accessibility.
``` ```suggestion
- **`aria-hidden` attribute**: Used to hide an element from people using assistive technology such as screen readers. For example, this can be used to hide decorative images that do not provide any meaningful content.
``` ```suggestion
- **Common Aria states**: Common Aria states include `aria-haspopup`, `aria-checked`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-selected`. These attributes can be used to indicate the state of an element and help people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the website.
``` ```suggestion
- **`aria-controls` attribute**: used to associate an element with another element that it controls. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the relationship between the elements.
``` ```suggestion
- **`aria-describedby` attribute**: used to provide additional information about an element by associating it with another element that contains the information. This gives people using screen readers immediate access to the additional information when they navigate to the element. Common usage would include associating formatting instructions to a text input or an error message to an input after an invalid form submission.
```

Sorry for the rewrite. Not sure it is worded as gracefully as it could be. ```suggestion
- **Aria roles**: a set of predefined roles that can be added to HTML elements to define their purpose. This helps people using screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the website. Examples include `role=""tab""`, `role=""menu""`, and `role=""alert""`.

This provides a TypeScript worker to compile JS and return any compilation errors to the client.

To play with it, visit http://localhost:8000/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game/step-31 or http://localhost:8000/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/boo-who

## Why a worker?

While it's possible use the monaco editor directly for your TS compilation needs, I think this decoupled approach should serve us well. It means we're treating TS as just another language, rather than having to create a ton of customisation just for it.

The main pain points I foresee are handling different TypeScript versions and multiple files. If the versions don't match it will likely result in a confusing difference between the error messages and the error highlighting.  Importing file a into  file b may simply mean emitting a.d.ts and using [addExtraLib](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/typedoc/interfaces/languages.typescript.LanguageServiceDefaults.html#addExtraLib) to make it available to file b. We'll see.

If the formatting mismatch becomes a problem, we can look into using the [TypeScript Sandbox](https://www.typescriptlang.org/dev/sandbox/) instead of Monaco. It's what powers the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) and is designed to handle multiple TS versions.

I'm not sure exactly. I'm thinking that within the JSON, they will have a chapter...

```

  ""chapters"":  [
    ...,
    {
      ""dashedName"": ""final-exam"",

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

That probably isn't the best. We would then need some client stuff to display that chapter as its own challenge or something. Or perhaps we can modify the structure - maybe give it a chapterType. I added the blocked label here because I want to rebase and fix up any curriculum stuff that was added right before this gets merged - to avoid tests failing on main. It could still use some reviews and approvals. Open curriculum PR's that add a new block will need to remove the order from the `meta.json` file and add the block where it fits in the `full-stack.json` fileLGTM.

Okay, this does a couple of things: it adds the `chapter` and `module` properties to the challenge object and it lets us control the order of the blocks via one config file. 

The `chapter` and `module` properties are included so that the client can access them when making GraphQL queries for challenges. This should be enough information to let us build the new UI. Though, we can always add more if necessary.

The rationale for controlling the order via a config file is partly because the information is already contained in the file (blocks had to go in and an array was the natural data structure), partly because it makes it trivial to change that order and partly because it gives us a nice high-level overview of what goes into a superblock.

The downside is that it adds a little extra complexity, because we have to support the existing approach (order property in the meta.json) for the time being. It's not very complicated, though, so even if we have to support both for years it should be okay.

Also, I ended up putting some blocks in the wrong modules, because it wasn't clear where to put them. The asynchronous-javascript, functional-programming and react modules all have some extra, since they seemed like the best fit.

Finally, I moved the typescript block to the correct place.

### TODO
- [x] ~rename superblock once https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56694/ is in~ on second thought, it doesn't matter which order these go in.
- [x] derive block order from structure config, not `order` property
- [x] update challenge schema (with apologies to the mobile team)
- [x] add a structure-schema analogous to the meta-schema
- [x] update Gatsby schemaCustomization to include `chapter` and `module`

``` ```suggestion
You should define an object constant named `projectStatus` with the correct project statuses and descriptions.
``` From a first quick read I thought I had to do this:
```js
const projectStatus = {
  PENDING: ""Pending Execution"",
  SUCCESS: ""Executed Successfully"",
  FAILURE: ""Execution Failed""
}
```
Reading the following user stories it's clear but it would be better to clarify the object structure here. And considering that `description` should be a key, it would be better to enclose it in backticks. ```suggestion

Initialize the `title` and `description` properties with the provided parameters. The class should also have a property named `status` that is set to the value `projectStatus.PENDING` by default.
``` ```suggestion
Your `ProjectIdea` class should initialize the `title` property and `description` property based on the parameters passed. It should also set the status to `projectStatus.PENDING`.
``` I would change the method name. It overrides the `toString` method inherited from the Object prototype. This is a bit misleading. It seems you should get something as a return value of `.pin()`, which is not required before, so it's confusing. Personally I think we should use always angular brackets to indicate placeholders and stop using square brackets for that.

Also, I would use words starting with lowercase letters and remove the `\n` from the first line. The output is already arranged in a multi-line fashion.

```suggestion
<ProjectIdeaBoard title> has <ProjectIdeaBoard count> idea(s)
<ProjectIdea title> (<ProjectIdea status description>) - <ProjectIdea description>
<ProjectIdea title> (<ProjectIdea status description>) - <ProjectIdea description>
``` I have updated the description in the latest comment, let me know what you think of it. I remember we agreed on using square brackets for placeholders, like step#2 [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/curriculum/challenges/english/25-front-end-development/lab-lunch-picker-program/66db529d37ad966480ebb633.md). I have reworded this a bit. done! In any case we are using both types of brackets https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/4cc7c54979f5c7715603648f4f497223a87e168f/curriculum/challenges/english/25-front-end-development/lab-date-conversion/66f686b8ebdb982fa8e14330.md?plain=1#L43

I prefer angular brackets (and I think it's more frequent to use them for that) but it would be okay as long as we are consistent. I would like to hear other thoughts on this. ```suggestion
1. You should define an object constant named `projectStatus` with the three keys: `PENDING`, `SUCCESS`, and `FAILURE`. Each status should be assigned an object with a `description` key with the value `Pending Execution`, `Executed Successfully`, and `Execution Failed`, respectively.
``` This is still confusing. When you use `pin`, you push a `ProjectIdea` to `ProjectIdeaBoard.ideas`. That's it.

It shouldn't be correlated to the result of calling `formatToString` after pinning an object.

`formatToString` should be tested in a separate test, setting the `ideas` array to a known content and checking the output.

Here I would simply test that calling `pin` adds the object to the `ideas` array. The same holds for `unpin`. Now, I have updated the hints and tested the inputs againtst the `ideas` array.

```
You should be able to pin a `ProjectIdea` object to your `ProjectIdeaBoard` using the `pin` method.
```
```
You should be able to unpin a `ProjectIdea` object to your `ProjectIdeaBoard` using the `unpin` method.
``` I think angular brackets are not a symbol for data types in JS so it is less confusing I have used angular brackets now."

would you mind reading through the documentation and checking off these? it's mandatory as part of opening a PR, be sure to read the documentation! Thanks for all your guidance and support. As this was first PR i made a lot of mistakes and everyone corrected me and i learned.
if you don't mind if you can help me remove the spam tag from #56420, #56379 i leave the decision up to you and i promise i won't bring this up again and won't repeat the same mistake again. Thanks again. SORRY for disturbing. Just requesting for my 1st hacktoberfest. There is only 20mins left for hacktoberfest to end.  Like I already told you in our discord community, the fact that this PR was merged does not make your previous PRs no longer spammy. They did not follow our contributing guidelines or the instructions outlined in the issue. That **is** spam, and we will not be removing the labels.This is a good start!

The array value of your `ingredients` property should have `""spaghetti""`, `""Parmesan cheese""`, `""pancetta""`, and `""black pepper""` in it.
``` ```suggestion
          ""In this workshop, you will review working with JavaScript objects by building a recipe tracker.""
``` ```suggestion
In this workshop, you will create a recipe tracker using JavaScript objects.
``` ```suggestion
You should create an array named `recipes`.
``` ```suggestion
Add the remaining properties from the following list to the `recipe1` object:
``` isNull should work here isNull should work here too We should insert a step after this to have them practice accessing properties from the object.

you can have them log to console just a couple of the properties Is there a reason why steps 4 and 5 need to be broken up into two separate steps?
Because I feel like once campers create the first object with will be able to create the next two objects pretty easily.

 We don't need these examples here.
Remember that the previous module was all about arrays which means they have already learned about and practiced working with the `push` method.

```suggestion
A third `recipe3` object has been filled in for you. It has the same properties as `recipe1` and `recipe2`.

Use the `push()` method to push all the recipes objects into the `recipes` array. Make sure to push `recipe1`, `recipe2`, and `recipe3` in that order.
``` since we are dealing with an array, it is fine to expect campers to push the objects in a specific order.

````suggestion
You should push all the recipes objects into the `recipes` array. Make sure to push them in the order they are declared.

```js
assert.deepEqual(recipes, [recipe1, recipe2, recipe3]);
```
```` ```suggestion
Now you should work on calculating the `averageRating`, `totalIngredients`, and the `difficultyLevel` for each recipe in the `recipes` array.
``` There should be another test here to prevent campers from hardcoding a result like this
<img width=""738"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 5 06 43‚ÄØPM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7ded3e9-e152-415f-add9-bfe05b3f4fa6"">


I would suggest a test that calls the function a few tests with the other recipe objects to prevent hardcoding
 same issue here

You need to have additional tests to prevent campers from doing this

<img width=""762"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 5 16 16‚ÄØPM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a297497f-8c1a-4b05-910b-ea585da9e068"">


 It would be better to remove this second sentence. we want campers to practice their problem solving and it should be up to them to think through what they need to do here. Plus they will have had some practice with conditions at this point. 

```suggestion
Create a `getDifficultyLevel` function with `cookingTime` as the parameter. 
``` ```suggestion
Create three new variables called `recipe1AverageRating`, `recipe1TotalIngredients`, and `recipe1DifficultyLevel`. For their values, call the function that corresponds to each variable name and pass in the appropriate `recipe1` property.
``` The directions don't mention logging the string followed by the variable name. But also, this didn't pass 

```md
console.log(""Recipe 1 Average Rating"",recipe1AverageRating) 
```

to make testing easier, we should just have them log the variables to the console which is what the directions say to do we should update this too based on the suggestions from earlier we should update this too based on the suggestions from earlier Looking at the sheet, I didn't realize loops haven't been taught yet. 
So we can't use a for of loop here

Update both steps 11 and 12 to have them update just the first few properties manually

```md
recipe1.averageRating = getAverageRating(recipe1.ratings);
recipe1.totalIngredients = getTotalIngredients(recipe1.ingredients);
recipe1.difficultyLevel = getDifficultyLevel(recipe1.cookingTime);

```
 then in the final step have supply the rest for them and mention that they will learn how to work with loops which will make it easier to update each of these 

 I was thinking it would be too much for them. But it's no big deal to merge them. So, I'll go ahead and do that. The basic syntax and example provided are not enough? Can the step go in after all the first and second objects and their properties have been filled in? Can you check again to see if what I have is good enough? Can you check again to see if what I have is good enough? 
The issue is that the current examples doesn't actual teach them.
The basic syntax shows them how to get through the step but they won't understand what is going on because this will be their first introduction into loops.

So if we are going to keep this here, this needs to be updated to teach loops and how the for of loop actual works like what does `for (const variable of iterable)` actually mean? 

So a more robust example that teaches them and mentions that they will learn more about loops in the next module is fine sure It's there now We should have a general hint like ```Your `getTotalIngredients` function should return the correct number of ingredients.``` Or something like that.

Then you can have several tests with multiple functions like we are doing in other workshops like here:

Use ""Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum"" for the main button
Use ""Certified Full Stack Developer"" for everything else Lint is failing for this PR Well, this is going to cause conflicts and/or make the tests fail on open curriculum PR's to the new cert - but we are just going to have to deal with them. I think this is ready to go.

There will inevitably be some open curriculum PR's when this gets merged, so here's what would need fixing on those:
-The folder in the `client/src/pages/front-end-development` needs to be moved to `client/src/pages/full-stack-developer`
-And the `index.md` file in there needs the superblock changed to `full-stack-developer`
-The superblock in the `meta.json` files for the block needs to be changed
I think that's it, some PR's might get conflicts in the `intro.json` file I added the blocked label here because I want to rebase and fix up any curriculum stuff that was added right before this gets merged - to avoid tests failing on main. It could still use some reviews and approvals.There were multiple versions in chat and in huddles about the name.

","Nit: We seem to use ""Full Stack"" as two words, so:

```suggestion
Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Relational Databases, React, and Node.js to become a certified full stack developer.
```

Also, I'm wondering if ""full stack developer"" should be capitalized. ```suggestion
This is the first workshop for the new full stack developer certification.
``` Do we still need the `-v9` part? I assume we will update the value when we rename the `curriculum/challenges/english/25-front-end-development` folder? yes I thought we should just stick with it. That's the format we've been using for a bit now. ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ "

","This adds boilerplate files for all the reviews up to the end of the CSS stuff. The numbers in the intro.json file weren't aligned with what's on the spreadsheet, so I made some minor changes there. It should be fine - but it did show me that many of the existing blocks don't have the correct order in the meta.json files anymore cause we've updated the sheet. I will make another PR to update all those.

No idea how this file was created. I've just deleted and committed the changes. Will that be enough? yup üëç  I noticed the same as Oliver on the tasks mentioned.

Yes, I add them, review and adjust when needed. I'll review them again and adjust those suggested by Oliver. I only glanced over this. Here's some things I found...

-There's a lot of answers without periods at the end. I think they should have periods if they're a sentence. (or whatever is appropriate)

-Tasks 39-45 all have the same paragraph to read and then a single question to answer - once we get the multi-question challenges working, we can maybe turn that into one of those.  Same with 94-98. And 148 - 151.

-There's a number of true or false questions. You could try to be consistent with the wording - e.g. ""Check if this sentence is true or false: (sentence)"" and ""Is it true or false: (sentence)"" -> Maybe ""Is the following statement true or false? (sentence)"" Or something consistent anyway.

-I would also try to be consistent with the instructions. The fill in the blank's usually have a ""Listen to the audio to complete the sentence below."" in the instructions heading - I think you've all made that kind of standard. The questions here have some instructions like that that are mixed. Sometimes the questions have something like ""Listen to the audio and answer: What does Bob want to know from Lisa?"" in the question text itself, sometimes there's something in the instructions header - but a lot of them don't have any instructions. I would try to be consistent.

I guess I like consistency. I'm not sure how important it really is on some of these - I would prefer it. Perhaps you should come up with a document for standards to follow. there's some changes to the `search-bar.json` file here - I don't think those are needed. Can you remove them @nieldakarla. Let me know if you need a hand. Hey, Nielda, I noticed a few dialogues were starting mid-word. Could you check if they sound okay to you?

I know we had a bug with the audio sounding different on different machines, but I thought we fixed it. I've made it to step 33. I'm not sure I'll be able to review all the rest, but gist is that a fair number of the dialogs start too late. Not much, but often part way through a word.

Speaking practices start from Dialogue 2 because I hadn't planned them when creating Dialogue 1. Since we don‚Äôt have speaking challenges, I designed tasks where learners choose between two options that characters might use. In the future, learners can practice speaking by repeating the selected answer, allowing them to check both understanding and speaking skills. 

Even if we can't implement speaking practice, these tasks will still be useful, as they work in either scenario.

Reading tasks are placed after the dialogue questions. For Dialogue 1, I created a summary, and for Dialogue 2 and 3, an email from one of the characters.

The reading blocks are currently enclosed in backticks, which doesn‚Äôt look appealing. It would be great if we could improve how they look, similar to the solution Oliver used for the fill-in-the-blanks.

I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll adopt all the solutions I‚Äôm proposing, but I‚Äôve created these tasks to start the discussion. Please feel free to try them out and share your thoughts.

``` When we talk about verb tenses, are we going to use the names in English or translate them. If we intend to translate, say, 'Present Simple', nothing to change here. Else, I'd suggest we keep the names of tenses in between backticks. Same comment as in task 8 for the names of tenses. As per the answers not having a period at the end, I recall this was an argument we had for A2. It was decided we should keep answers without this last period. Feedback sentences, instead, would keep the regular punctuation. Remove ""The word"" from the beginning of the sentence and uppercase the 'W' in 'who's'. A doubt I have is whether it is possible to add the header instructions to a challenge type 19 task; I'd replace 'words' with 'phrases' here. Present Continuous in between backticks here, perhaps? Backticks missing here. Hello, Tom! Thank you for your review. I'll reply each topic you mentioned below:

- Periods at the end: Talked to Daniel and here's what he suggested:
Is the alternative a sentence/phrase? *It takes normal punctuation.*
Is the alternative just, for example, a noun with an adjective? *No punctuation.*

- Multi-questions challenges: That would be amazing! Looking forwards to this change.

- True or False consistency: Agreed. I think I'll adopt ""Is it true or false:"" It's short, simple and easy to understand.

- Mixed instructions: In this curriculum I'm trying new approach so we can test more complex thinking skills. Many type 19 will have an audio and ask comprehension questions instead of asking to select what the caracter is saying. I like the idea of adding #--instructions-- to the type 19 and keep #--text-- only with the question.
I'll review the block so these instructions are within the # --instructions -- section not the # --text--

- I also agree with the idea of a document for standards to follow. This first block and everyone's feedback will be ideal to do that. Thank you so much!

Next steps: I'll now review the individual comments you and Daniel made and add a new commit with the changes. I'm changing all the time tenses to be in backticks. =) Thank you, Daniel! I'm applying these changes as I review the block. Thank you! ```suggestion

This PR:
- Includes block name in the message to help make it clearer
- Fixes the curriculum files in question

","weren't instructions added in a PR recently? Honestly, I'm not sure what the difference is or which should be used when.

But the warnings show up because this challenge type isn't supposed to omit `description` (`description` being `undefined`).

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/7ddd7add076e84a97ed23c8c0b799d3b6c296d30/tools/client-plugins/gatsby-source-challenges/create-challenge-nodes.js#L19-L29

Only these two files got the warning, so I assumed them having `instructions` instead of `description` is unintended. https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56472/files it is intended, it is the first application of the new instructions section cc/ @moT01 
 We can probably just make `description` default to an empty string and delete the warning. We already pretend that the type of `description` is `string`, after all, so all the client code is written under the assumption that it is defined. The instructions and description can show up in different places (above or below the video) - so changing the heading might change the UI. I think we could probably do what Oliver suggests, or just add this challenge type to that list for now. The comment mentions seeds and instructions, so I default them to an empty string as well. Sorry to be a pain, but this belongs in the `generateChallengeCreator` function in get-challenges. That sets up the challenge, so it's better not to spread the responsibility around.

Also, the output of get-challenges goes through the challenge schema, so we can validate that these properties are defined. ```suggestion
```
Oops. The seed is already checked for (as part of the challenge file validation)."

 changes done please check @a2937 I resolved the comments please check Overall, I think there a many good questions here with regards to accessibility and CSS, but I also feel there are a few that don't really hit the target, such as the alt attribute on an image, or what is a screen reader. I'll try to come up with a few that could replace those. First one:

Which CSS media feature can be used to help people who are sensitive to motion?
- prefers-no-motion
- prefers-minimum-motion
- prefers-motion
- prefers-reduced-motion 

Ahh, I see that this question and the next one on target size might not be appropriate for this quiz based on the following rules:

```
All quiz questions need to relate to one of these topics:

    -properly hiding content
    -colour contrast (WCAG standard)
        -tools for checking this (inspect element, online ""put in the css"" sites)
```

My bad. Feel free to ignore them. I'll try to come up with some more questions that fall under these guidelines. Oops @naomi-lgbt, sorry about accidentally closing this. I really wish github would change the UI to make it harder to do by accident. (And then I went and did it again.)

Another question:

What is the minimum clickable space required for a button to be considered accessible?

- 48 by 48 px
- 16 by 16 px
- 32 by 32 px
- 24 by 24 px I think this question falls under the color contrast guideline.

Which CSS media feature can be used to help people who are sensitive to light?

- prefers-dark-mode
- prefers-light-mode
- prefers-dark-scheme
- prefers-color-scheme > sorry about accidentally closing this

All good! I've done it more times than you'll ever catch me admitting. ü§£  Which CSS technique prevents screen reader users from accessing the content?

- opacity: 0
- color: transparent
- text-indent: -10000px

","This question feels too similar to an earlier one. Can you change it?  ```suggestion
What is the minimum contrast ratio for large text?
```

I wouldn't say ""ideal"" here. WCAG is a bare minimum for accessibility. 3:1 is the bare minimum required for large text, not the ""ideal"".  If this is referring to `display: none`, then this property removes the element from the DOM completely. There is a difference between visually hiding an element and removing it from the DOM. So while removing an element from the DOM does prevent it from being visually rendered, I think this question is giving a false impression that that is all the `display` property does. ```suggestion
What is the minimum required contrast ratio for accessible text?
```

WCAG defines the minimum requirement, not the recommended ratio.  `visibility: hidden` removes the element from the accessibility tree and thus hides it from people using assistive technology, such as screen readers. So while technically the element might still show in the DOM inspector, it really isn't there for people using assistive technology. Unfortunately, there is no single property that can properly ""visually hide"" an element at this time. ```suggestion
To hide content from screen readers
``` I'm not sure what the purpose of this question is with regards to accessibility. Using `visibility: hidden` removes the element from the accessibility tree, thus hiding it from screen reader users and such. You would never user it to visually hide content. Again, WCAG does not define ideals, it defines the bare minimum for accessibility. Even `7:1` may be hard to read for some people. I do not think it is a good idea to assume there are ""ideal"" contrast ratios. I don't think this is a good question. It is too ambiguous. What type of hiding is being done? If this quiz is about CSS and accessibility, then improving SEO should probably not be one of the correct answers as most accessibility professionals do not consider that a valid reason for improving accessibility. I would probably change this to something like ""Which color combination has the potential to provide the highest contrast ratio"", since pure black on white will give you the highest possible ratio. But since there are so many different shades of colors, it is possible to meet minimum contrast ratios with green on red or blue on yellow.  I think this question needs to clarify what type of hiding is being done. Is this ""visually hiding"" content from sighted people while still making the content accessible to assistive technology? If so, then only `opacity: 0` accomplishes that. `display: none` doesn't just ""hide"" content, it completely removes it from the DOM. While `visibility: hidden` does visually hide the content and leaves it in the DOM but removes it from the accessibility tree, which removes it for people using assistive technology, such as screen readers. I think the wording on this question needs to be clarified. All four of the methods listed will hide content from screen readers and other assistive technology. I think perhaps the question is asking what will allow you to hide content from ONLY assistive technology, such as screen readers, while allowing it to remain accessible to everyone else. It doesn't look like much of a tester. I'm sure others can weigh in.

Something like WebAIM seems better. https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ 
 What's with the extra white space?  The poster property is only used to display an image when video data is not available on an HTMLVideoElement. It is not used for audio elements. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/poster  Extra blank line added  As I had found out the other day, these answers will be potentially be shuffled. So all of the above is probably not the right phrase to use.  This question feels too vague to me. In order to see an image, yes we need a `src` attribute. But for images to be handled properly by a screen-reader and other assistive technologies.  Hi there can you explain where the `7:1` came from? Because according to this, non-text content needs a minimum contrast ratio of ""3:1"". 

Source: https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/  Outlines don't immediately affect focus indicators. Rather they affect the border of an element. You can use it in a pseudo-class to change a focus indicator, but it is beyond the scope of this question. 

Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline  What exactly excludes Google Chrome from this list? While I personally dislike the browser, it does offer Google Lighthouse.  This is a very controversial answer and I have a feeling most accessibility professionals would not agree. The title attribute has several accessibility issues, such as people who use the keyboard only (which includes screen reader users) will not be able to activate the tooltip. People using touch devices may also have problems activating the tooltip. In general, it is best to avoid the title attribute except on iframes, where it is basically required. I don't think there is a good answer to this question and it should probably be removed. Well, to be honest, I'm a profession accessibility auditor and I never use Lighthouse, and I always use the developer tools, so I would get this answer wrong. There are also many extensions that I use for accessibility testing. I would probably change the wording of this question to something like ""What automated testing tool is provided by Chrome to aid in accessibility testing?"" Ya, going to agree here. This is very subjective and might not be a good question.  ```suggestion

It's better if I do a single commit in VSCode instead I guess ? Hey @hedocode,

Your consideration for trying to avoid making separate commit for each review suggestion is really appreciated.

If you go to the _[Files changed](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56487/files)_ tab, you can batch multiple suggestion changes into single commit. Applying suggested changes like that, in opened PR perfectly fine. Ok, great ! I did that and some few more changes depending on previous applied suggestion. Do you see anything more I can do ? I had some unknown ""file delete change"" in VSCode, and I accidentally pushed them with my temporary checklist.

I did revert the last commit and then only commit the noun add, I might push it after a last check, to fix it asap. Hmmm well, I think I identified my problem by recloning the repo from scratch.

Using Git on windows I got :

```suggestion

one of these two make more sense I think ```suggestion
You have an HTML page with a 100x100 pixel canvas identified by the `""art""` id, and the following code:
``` ""id"" was previously changed to ""ID"" due to naomi suggestion in the following commit :
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56487/commits/eefd6db096130479512c8e8601e610669b8b03e8

Which one should I apply ? There is one other occurence line 434 :
> timer's id You are right, I personnaly like the second option, might be more clear to people not familiar with the `#` notation, I would even add ""to scale _**it**_ down"". @naomi-lgbt maybe should answer this There are two options. If we want to specifically refer to the attribute, it needs to be in code tags `` `id` ``. If we are referring to the abbreviated *meaning*, ""identifier"", then it should be `ID`. ```suggestion
element.toggleAttribute(""disabled"", !element.hasAttribute(""disabled""));
```
Otherwise there's `SyntaxError`. Yes, that's an intended `SyntaxError` for it to be a distractor, otherwise it would be an other working solution. @naomi-lgbt here your answer is required I modified this in the following commit : https://github.com/hedocode/HACKTOBERFEST-2024-DOM-and-Click-Events-Quiz-56206/commit/b9fca843a8790234a8c6662576e57ab9521f2e0c
Tell me if that suits you. But the code should be working and toggling the attribute üòõ. Question is asking for option that's not doing it."

          ""In this workshop, you'll build a set of colored markers. You'll practice different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other.""
``` ```suggestion
In this project you'll work with an external CSS file to style the page. A `styles.css` file has been already created for you. But before you can use it, you'll need to link it to the page.
``` ```suggestion
Now that you've practiced with secondary colors, you'll review how to create <dfn>tertiary colors</dfn>. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.
``` ```suggestion
It looks like your sleeve disappeared, but don't worry ‚Äî it's still there. What happened is that your new cap `div` is taking up the entire width of the marker, and is pushing the sleeve down to the next line.
``` ```suggestion
        ""title"": ""Build a Set of Colored Markers"",
``` ```suggestion
title: Introduction to the Build a Set of Colored Markers
``` ```suggestion
## Introduction to the Build a Set of Colored Markers
``` ```suggestion
  ""name"": ""Build a Set of Colored Markers"",
``` ```suggestion
First, within the `body` element, add a `div` element with a `class` attribute set to `container`. Make sure the `div` element is placed below the `h1` element.
``` ```suggestion
Your marker would look better if it were centered on the page. An easy way to do this is by using the `margin` <dfn>shorthand property</dfn>.
``` ```suggestion
To give the markers different colors, you‚Äôll need to add a unique class to each one. You can add multiple classes to an element by listing them in the `class` attribute and separating them with a space. For example, the following code adds both the `animal` and `dog` classes to a `div` element:
``` ```suggestion
Add the class `two` to the second marker `div` and the class `three` to the third marker `div`.
``` ```suggestion
As you have learned in the lectures, there are two main color models: the <dfn>additive</dfn> RGB (red, green, blue) model, used in electronic devices, and the <dfn>subtractive</dfn> CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model, used in print.
``` ```suggestion
In this project, you'll work with the RGB model. This means colors start as black and change as different levels of red, green, and blue are introduced. An easy way to see this is with the CSS `rgb` function.
``` ```suggestion
Now that you've practiced with secondary colors, let‚Äôs review how to create <dfn>tertiary colors</dfn>. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary color with a nearby secondary color.
``` ```suggestion
To create the tertiary color orange, update the `rgb` function in the `.one` CSS rule by setting red to its maximum value (`255`) and green to `127`.
``` ```suggestion
Notice that, to create orange, you increased the intensity of red and decreased the intensity of green in the `rgb` values. This is because orange is created by blending red with yellow.
``` ```suggestion
To create the tertiary color spring green, combine cyan with green. Update the `rgb` function in the `.two` CSS rule by setting green to its maximum value and blue to `127`.
``` ```suggestion
To create the tertiary color violet, combine magenta with blue. Update the `rgb` function in the `.three` CSS rule by setting blue to its maximum value and red to `127`.
``` ```suggestion
In the `h1` CSS rule, remove the `background-color` property and its value to revert to the default white color.
``` ```suggestion
Update the `rgb` function in the `.red` CSS rule by setting the red value to its maximum.
``` ```suggestion
Next, change the class `two` to `green` in the second marker `div` and change the class `three` to `blue` in the third marker `div`.

`forEach` always returns `undefined` and it is meant for side effects. It doesn't matter if the callback has an implicit or explicit return, the callback can't return anything.

In fact, we might want to avoid the expression body syntax with `forEach`. Seeing as the callback can't return anything, implying otherwise by using an implicit return could be seen as dishonest syntax. Don't get me wrong, I have certainly written `forEach` loops with an expression body before. I'm just not sure if we should be promoting it.

```
numbersArr.forEach((el) => {
  counts[el] = (counts[el] || 0) + 1;
});
```


Also, this is just my personal opinion, but the way it is worded makes it sound like they should prefer the much less readable version because the readable version is too verbose. Furthermore, simplification is not the same as shorter syntax, in this case, I would say the shorter version is not a simplification because it is harder to read.

All this just to say, I think we have to be careful about what we promote and how we do it. Hi @a2937 could you take a look at these conflicts?

@naomi-lgbt it's ready for another review. > it's ready for another review.

Negative - we're still using an example that passes the tests. I apologize for forgetting about this PR. I will go ahead and update the tests and resolve the merge conflicts.  There were other challenges that changed the meta. The best way to resolve the issue was to rebase this PR. Hope that is understandable.  Hi @a2937, the issue here is just that the braces are dropped without explanation. This goes against the general pattern that the solution to the current challenge should be the seed for the next one.

Also, both syntaxes `() => 1` and `() => { return 1; }` have been introduced before. At most, we need to remind people of the concise form - we don't need to define it.

I think it's good to add an extra step, so we can ask for the shorter syntax and justify it. I just wouldn't define it again. Okay so don't define arrow syntax again. Got it.  Sorry, @a2937, I've been going back through the curriculum and I can't find anywhere that introduces the form without curly braces. We just sort of start using it without telling anyone, which isn't great.

This makes me think this isn't really a problem with the stat calculator. Perhaps it would be better to add a lesson introducing them to https://www.freecodecamp.dev/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-basic-string-and-array-methods-by-building-a-music-player once we've introduced arrow functions in general. i.e. after step 11. Then all the stat calculator lesson needs to mention is ""hey, we can clean this function up using the concise syntax"".

What do you reckon?

Also, @naomi-lgbt any thoughts? It is taught in step 15: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-string-and-array-methods-by-building-a-music-player/step-15 Ah, so it is, my mistake! Thanks for finding that.

In which case, all we need to do is mention that they should refactor to use the implicit return. 
I'm confused by this PR.

Firstly, we are already teaching how to use a count object with an arrow function for the `forEach` callback in step 30. The new requirement in step 35 for an arrow function is only relevant because we now want to require an _expression body_ for the callback. Which you can only do using an arrow function. So the requirement on its own makes sense, but the reason we give does not.

Secondly, requiring an expression body for the callback doesn't magically make people able to convert what we taught [in step 30](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-advanced-array-methods-by-building-a-statistics-calculator/step-30), to an expression instead. Nor will it magically make people write the same code as our seed code, or understand it for that matter.

We start by allowing all valid solutions, including a block body with a statement for the assignment, which is what we teach in step 30. We now force an expression body, which means any statement inside the callback body must be converted to an expression.

Are we really expecting people will write and understand this code on their own...

```
counts[el] = (counts[el] || 0) + 1
```

...just as a consequence of forcing an expression body for the `forEach` callback body? Because, I don't see why that would be the case?

If we force an expression body for the callback, we can't just leave it there. We now have to make sure they know how to use an ""occurrences count object"" with an expression. Which we didn't teach or give example code of how to do.

This body content, which is what we teach in step 30, does not work with an expression body.

```
if (counts[el]) {
  counts[el] += 1;
} else {
  counts[el] = 1;
}
```

Somewhat ironically, the code we previously magically expected people to write, before we added new steps to teach how to use an ""occurrences count object"", and also allow all valid solutions, works with both types of callbacks. It doesn't matter what type of body is used.

```
counts[el] = (counts[el] || 0) + 1
```

Besides, this is not the only valid expression, what about a ternary, why is that not a valid expression they can use?

```
array.forEach((el) => (counts[el] =  counts[el] ?  counts[el] +  1  :  1));
```

So this all seems backwards. We are not teaching the camper how to use an expression for the callback, we are still introducing an expression as the requirement, but not just any valid expression only the seed code expression, because we hope that will make them understand the seed code???

---

Sorry for the long post, but I can't understand what we are doing here? If we absolutely want to keep the seed code, we should create a step that shows and explains it as part of teaching how to convert the callback block body to an expression body. We could show how to do it using a ternary as well. Then just have them write it, even though we gave them the solution as part of the explanation. But we should still make sure any valid solution using an expression body will pass.

Giving them the solution is not much different from how we teach in step 30-34 anyway. It is entirely possible to learn from code without coming up with the solution yourself. Sure, this might not be in line with how we run most of the curriculum, but I think using that format occasionally isn't all bad.

---

Super quick example of what I mean (wip and all).

````md
There is another way to write the `forEach`. Instead of using a block body `() => {}` for the callback, you can use an expression body `() =>`.
Without a code block inside the callback, we have to convert the statements we had into an expression. *Maybe explain why*

For example, we could write it like so:
```
array.forEach(el => counts[el] = (counts[el] || 0) + 1)
```

*Code explanation if needed*

Or we could use a ternary:

```
array.forEach(el => counts[el] = counts[el] ? counts[el] + 1 : 1);
```

*Code explanation if needed*

Convert the `forEach` callback from using a block body to an expression body.
```` I don't wanna give campers a copy pastable solution to the challenge as an example. Not really. It's bad enough about Step 30 and the following four steps. 

The point of this was to have a step that bridges the gap between the two different pieces of seed code. However as you said, the seed code solution is not the only answer.  > The point of this was to have a step that bridges the gap between the two different pieces of seed code.

But it doesn't bridge the gap. Requiring an expression body doesn't solve anything related to the issue.

We can't ""coerce"" the camper into writing, and more importantly understanding, our seed code just by forcing them to use an expression body for the callback.

What we could do is teach how to convert the callback to use an expression body and convert the statements to an expression. And in doing so, also explain our seed code in the process. We can change the object name and values so all that is left is the ""shape"" of the code. We are teaching something new, by explaining a refactor.

Our seed code is not the logical conclusion that anyone will reach just by us requiring an expression body. Doing so will not explain the seed code, nor will it particularly help guide the camper to write it just like we have it in the seed code.

A lot of people on the forum can barely understand the seed code. Or have it wrong, but think they understand it. For example, some people think the initial value assignment is `0` and not `0 + 1` and I don't blame them, because the code is not that easy to read.

TL;DR We have to explain the seed code, or remove it.

 I really don't wanna keep the seed code at the end of the day. It's a little too complicated for the average person. Unfortunately the best option I can really think of is to change the seed code so the sudden switch doesn't happen.

  We may have to guide them a bit more than just asking for a ternary. A lot of beginners will put the assignments inside the ternary conditions and while that works it isn't what we expect and not the proper use of a ternary.

For example, they might write:
```
array.forEach(el => counts[el] ? counts[el] += 1 : counts[el] = 1);
```

---
Here is another version.

````md
There is another way to write the `forEach`. Instead of using a block body `() => {}` for the callback, you can use an expression body `() =>`.

You will have to convert the `if...else` statements into an expression. Write the expression as a ternary and use a single assignment for the ternary.

```
assigment = condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
```

Convert the `forEach` callback to use an expression body and replace the statements with a ternary.
```` I think we should add the assignment part to the ternary code example.

```js
assigment = condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

I added an extra step and did my best to explain how to transform the arrow function into the shorthand seen in the later steps. ","```suggestion
In this example, the `numbersArr` has each element looped through like before. Only this time, it removes the if statement and replaces it with an `or` operator. This `or` operator says if `counts[el]` is falsy to return the other value. 
``` ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
An value can be considered <dfn>falsy</dfn> if it is `null`, `undefined`, or otherwise can be evaluated as false. 
```

Though I do feel like we've taught this before. ```suggestion
An example of such an expression is the following: 
``` We might have explained it in the shopping cart curriculum though it might not hurt to explain it multiple times.  ````suggestion
Your `forEach` loop is fully functional, but it's very verbose. You can actually simplify it further.

To do so, you will need to use an <dfn>arrow function expression</dfn>. This kind of function expression does not use curly braces, opting for a more compact single-line syntax.

Here is an example of an arrow function expression: 

```js
const numbersArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4];
const counts = {};
numbersArr.forEach(el => counts[el] = (counts[el] || 0) + 1)
```

In this example, `forEach` still iterates through every value in the array. The callback is now an arrow function expression.

The `(counts[el] || 0)` falls back to `0` when `counts[el]` is `undefined`, or another falsy value. This ensures that `counts[el]` will be incremented by 1, or initialised to 1 if the property does not have a truthy value.

Replace the callback in your `forEach` to an arrow function expression like the example.
```` Not sure how I feel about an example that could pretty much be copy-pasted. Oh. Yeah that's an issue. :( I should probably fix it.  I've updated the example.  Just a thought... We already test the function implementation by asserting the returned value is correct. So rather than a regular expression against the function body, should we regex this bit:

```
array.forEach(el =>
```

And assert it is not followed by a `{`? That code also isn't the only valid expression. You could use a ternary.

So yes, we shouldn't force that single expression as the only valid solution. That'd probably be pretty reasonable. "

Notes
- Step 1 - browser appears to fix many of the incorrectly defined `html`, `head`, `body`, including the lack of them.
- Step 18 & 29, wanna see _funny_ trick?
  1. Go to any page (not fCC limited, youtube could be used as well), for example https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game/step-18
  2. Open browser's console.
  3. Type either in browser's console, or in the editor: `console.log(button2)`
  4. See appear the `#button2` element in console.
  5. Try it with other ids with names that could be proper JS variables.
  6. Also see their elements printed in console.
  7. You can be as confused as I am.
- Steps with `pick` function and `if` statements. `pick.toString()` will added infinite loop protection to the loops. This uses `if`, which makes using `pick.toString()` to match `if` less convenient.","What was the issue with all these tests? I don't think I'm seeing any problems with how they were. I think these were fine how they were. When I add `button1.onclick = buyHealth;` outside of the `goStore` function, I get the ""You should use dot notation to access the `onclick` property of `button1`"" message. But I did what the message says, just not where it's being tested. I would revert these, unless I'm missing something - but it seems to work how it was.

 Similar to my thoughts on step 29 - I didn't see an issue with these how they were, but maybe I'm missing something. In current form this test is not really checking anything - it matches seed code.

What do you think about adding to the hint text something like: _in your `goStore` function_? ```suggestion
assert.lengthOf(document.querySelectorAll('#stats > .stat'), 3);
```"

Thanks for your interest in contributing. We appreciate your efforts, but this PR doesn't follow [our guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/how-to-open-a-pull-request).

Do not worry, you should join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA) server and ask for help in the `#contributors` channel. That will help other contributors guide you to get your PR ready for a review. 

Happy Contributing! Could you make such change to other JavaScript projects as well?

Since it is the exact same problem, and fixing in to other projects will not bloat the PR, you can make changes here here. Just push further commits to the same branch on GitHub, and new changes will be reflected in the PR. Hi @khushi144 . Congrats on your first pull request (PR)! üéâ

There are two bugs left to fix. First, if you create a task with only spaces for the title, an empty task will be created even though the title is required.
``` ```suggestion
It is time to work on the final issue. If there is a to-do task with a special character like a quote inside of the name or description of the item, the application breaks. While it appears otherwise, the correct item will appear missing.  

In order to fix this, we need to create a function called `removeSpecialChars` that takes a string as input and removes all special characters. 
``` ```suggestion
You should define a `removeSpecialChars` function.

Your `removeSpecialChars` should remove single quotes.

Your `removeSpecialChars` should remove double quotes.

Originally, there was a constraint to keep all exam tokens. However, I cannot remember the exact reason for this. So, this also removes it, and we will have to just see if the constraint resurfaces.","In order to impose this constraint we should `prisma db push` or create the constraint by hand. That applies to the prod db as well as the tests. > Why not not include this in the user object?

Include what in the `user` object? This PR includes the token in the `user` object.

> In order to impose this constraint we should prisma db push or create the constraint by hand.

What are you saying? This is a new collection (does not exist yet). So, the constraint cannot cause issues? > Include what in the user object? This PR includes the token in the user object.

Yeah, that. There's already an endpoint to get the token, so why put it in the user object?

> What are you saying? This is a new collection (does not exist yet). So, the constraint cannot cause issues?

That adding the constraint to the schema does nothing on its own - it has to be applied to the dbs (e.g. via `prisma db push`) to take effect. > There's already an endpoint to get the token, so why put it in the user object?

Oh. Sorry. My brain ignored the second _""not""_ in your sentence.

Reason: There is no endpoint to get the token. There is only an endpoint to generate it.

Would you just create an endpoint to GET/generate it? >  it has to be applied to the dbs

Ah. I thought you were suggesting we needed a migration to use the constraint. > Oh. Sorry. My brain ignored the second ""not"" in your sentence.

Nah, it's my fault.

> There is only an endpoint to generate it.
>
> Would you just create an endpoint to GET/generate it?

Well, how this is normally done is you get one chance to save your token and then it's gone.  e.g. if you create a PAT on GitHub. So, I don't think we need to create a new endpoint or return it as part of the user object.

I think that pattern makes sense, since the exam environment is going to store the token for the learner. Very true. Thank you. ```suggestion
        expect(decodedToken).not.toHaveProperty(
          'examEnvironmentAuthorizationToken',
          id
        );
```
Nit: this seems better aligned with what we're interested in (that the token has updated)."

``` In most quizzes I've taken they usually say ""All of the above"" when all of the choices are valid and it's the last possible option.  the choices will be in random order @a2937  It looks like question might be missing some part that would justify the answer. Otherwise having files with spaces between words is perfectly fine... oh Spaces in filenames are harder to work with in the command line because the command line treats spaces as a delimiter so a path with a space could cause issues.

In the web, spaces are converted into %20, which would make it harder to manage like `image 1.png` becomes `image$201.png`, which is confusing.

Different operating systems might treat the character differently, which may be an issue when you use the file on different systems.

Although you can put spaces in file names, it should be avoided if possible to prevent issues. Yes, there are situations, when spaces might cause some inconvenience (though none from your examples would be really a deal-breaker). Question doesn't mention any such context. ah ok, should I change it then? Yes please. Either of these will work: changing just the answer, just the question text, or whole question. Ok, I changed the answer."

This does include an `<hr>` where none was before, but https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56749 removes it.

I deliberately didn't change the challengeType because it will cause conflicts, it's not strictly necessary and there are bits of logic that care about the challengeType, other than viewType, and I wanted to keep the scope of this PR small.

Discussed with Tom, and the best course of action for the MVP release is probably only one prerequisite challenge being the Capstone project.

From there, we can discuss the complexities of prerequisites and our constantly changing curriculum.","Pretty minor, but I would just pass around the array of completedChallenges. Reason being, this function doesn't need to know about the structure of `user`. We can make it (and its types) even simpler by only supplying the relevant data.  ```suggestion
    user.completedChallenges.some(c => c.id === p)
```
Slightly more direct. ```suggestion
type CompletedChallenges = {
  id: string;
}[];
```
To go with the suggestion below. ```suggestion
          message: 'User has not completed prerequisites.'
```
Again, minor, but we know the message, so we can just use it. I do mention elsewhere in the tests that we do not necessarily want to test the exact string returned here, because it is not a guaranteed part of the api - it is an additional explanation.

So, a changing `code` is a breaking change, but the `message`s can change anyhow we see fit. E.g. in this case, I expect to change this to add additional information like `User has not completed challenges ""a"", ""b"", ""c"".` For now, no. My main reason for passing the whole user _was_ to allow for additional checks on the user object. E.g. `isBanned`/`isCheater`, `acceptedPrivacyTerms`, `completedExams`, `emailVerified` (debatable), `needsModeration`. Makes sense. I would still probably make it strict once you've settled on `User has not completed challenges ""a"", ""b"", ""c"".`, though. At that point it's unlikely to change very often."

Added questions, answers and distractors for the quiz on understanding javascript dates and date methods.
","Not necessarily, because that depends on the locale. This also depends on the locale. ```suggestion
To get the current month (0 - 11) we use which instance method of the `Date` object?
``` ```suggestion
The built-in JavaScript method that allows us to format a date as a string is?
``` ```suggestion
What would output `console.log(new Date().getFullYear());`, if it would be the year `2022`?
```
Although it's a bit giving out the answer. This will depend on the locale. ```suggestion

> Could the block layout be derived from block type?

No. The block type determines the label. Sometimes the challenge layout is different for the same block type. For instance the RWD workshops show the grid cause of the steps, the RDB workshops show the link cause it's just one challenge that opens gitpod, but still a workshop.

","This is an attempt to make the blocks look a little better on the superblock page. There's a long way to go, but it also should make it easier to make changes in the future.

It changes the existing `challenge-list` and `link` block layouts to `legacy-challenge-list` and `legacy-link` - and adds two new layouts of the original names. This is so I could make changes to the block layouts without affecting the existing layouts.

Extracts a few things from block.tsx into their own components.

Updates all the full stack meta.json files to include a blockLayout.

Some other misc changes might have snuck in there.

Just wanting to get this in for the demo. Maybe @naomi-lgbt can weigh in. Yeah, if this is just for the demo, then we can merge in as is and then revisit this later.

Thanks for the tip! :) I'm doing this on the mobile app and didn't see that option. it would be great if you didn't bush 21 consecutive times, the tests run for each (even if not all as they need to be manually approved to run all of them), it still clogs the tests queue and it's disrupting, so if you could please do one single commit next time it would be great @CBID2 I'm not using GitHub mobile so I don't know how the UI looks.

What is accessibility?
``` ```suggestion
Accessibility is a set of standardized practices that ensure online content can be viewed by users with disabilities.
``` ```suggestion
What is the best practice for creating accessible headings?
``` The question asks for six, so I think the distractors should have six categories in them, rather than just one. Otherwise, it's quite easy to pick the correct answer. ```suggestion
What is the correct way to add an `alt` attribute to an `<img>` tag?
``` ```suggestion
alt=""cat running""<img src=""cat.jpg""> 
``` ```suggestion
alt=""""<img src=""cat.jpg""> 
``` ```suggestion
<img src=""cat.jpg""> alt=""cat running""
``` ```suggestion
<img src=""cat.jpg"" alt=""cat running""> 
``` This is a full sentence, so I think we should add a punctuation.

```suggestion
Accessibility focuses on making websites faster to load.
``` ```suggestion
Accessibility is a belief to make websites compatible with older browsers.
``` ```suggestion
Accessibility is a type of coding style.
``` ```suggestion
Place `h6` headings at the beginning of your webpage 
``` Could we rephrase this to make it a question?

However, I think we probably should cover `aria-hidden` instead, as `hidden` isn't really under the a11y umbrella? We should change the wording to question form. There shouldn't be an empty line here.

```suggestion
``` For tables, usually having the correct table elements (`th`, `tr`, `td`) should be sufficient, so I'm not sure in which cases `header` and `id` should be used.

From WebAIM (https://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data):
> The `headers` and `id` attributes
>
> Another way to associate data cells and headers is to use the headers and id attributes. This method is NOT generally recommended because scope is usually sufficient for most tables, even if the table is complex with multiple levels of headers. This question is duplicated. We have the same one on line 115. This question is duplicated. We have the same one on line 136. Let's change the wording to question form. ```suggestion
The function of `aria-expanded` is to indicate whether a control is currently expanded or collapsed, and whether its associated content is displayed or hidden
``` Would this be clearer?

```suggestion
What is the correct way to describe the purpose of form inputs?
```

---

I'm maybe reading too much into this, but I'd replace ""best"" with ""correct"" since the former might imply that the distractor options are correct approaches and the question looks for the best one amongst those. ```suggestion
Use separate `label` and `input` elements without any association
``` ```suggestion
Use placeholder text instead of actual `label` elements for form inputs
``` ```suggestion
Use nested `div` elements to group labels and inputs together
``` ```suggestion
Use the `for` attribute on `label`s and matching `id` attribute on `input`s to associate them
``` ```suggestion

How does a screen magnifier help visually-impaired users navigate web pages?
``` ```suggestion
What is the function of the `aria-haspopup` attribute?
``` Watch out for the empty lines. It may throw off the parser if we remove those lines. 

```suggestion

The `aria-haspopup` attribute is used to indicate that an element has keyboard shortcuts associated with it
``` This distractor doesn't fit the question. Should it be a `kbd` option instead?"

I have made a new commit with requested changes @gikf  ```suggestion
All functions in JavaScript, including those that do not manipulate or return other functions, can be classified as higher-order functions.
``` ```suggestion
`forEachRes` is `undefined` and `mapRes` is `[1,2,3,4,5]`
``` ```suggestion
`forEachRes` is `0` and `mapRes` is `[1,2,3,4,5]`
``` ```suggestion
`forEachRes` is `5` and `mapRes` is `[1,2,3,4,5]`
``` ```suggestion
`forEachRes` is `undefined` and `mapRes` is `[6,7,8,9,10]`
``` ```suggestion
[<1 empty item>, 'a', 'b', undefined, { '20': 5 }]
``` ```suggestion
[{ '20': 5 }, 'a', 'b', undefined, <1 empty item>]
``` ```suggestion
A function that is called immediately upon declaration.

---
``` This is edge case, but not necessarily. Depending on the callback and initial value, it might be ie. array as well. Isn't this technically also method chaining? Perhaps, question could be changed to specifically ask for correct usage? why do you have this as an header?

```suggestion
A function that is called immediately upon declaration.
``` ```suggestion
---

A function that is invoked with a specific context.
```

do not remove separators or empty lines ```suggestion
`false`, `every()` will not run its predicate on empty slots.

---
``` ```suggestion
`undefined`
``` ```suggestion
What is the impact of using `bind()` on a higher-order function in JavaScript?
```

you need to use backticks ```suggestion
`null`
``` ```suggestion
`bind()` creates a new function with a specific this context, but does not change the function's parameters.
```

find the other places and add backticks please ```suggestion
`true`, `every()` will not run its predicate on empty slots.
``` this returns a number, there aren't many methods you can chain on a number. Is it even appropriate to have it here? ```suggestion
`false`, `every()` will not run its predicate on empty slots.

---
``` ```suggestion
The returned array remains sparse, and the callback is not invoked for empty slots.

``` ```suggestion
`originalArray` remains unchanged.
``` ```suggestion
`originalArray` only retains the elements filtered out.
``` ```suggestion
`originalArray` is completely different from `filteredArray`.
``` ```suggestion
`originalArray` reflects changes made to `filteredArray` due to shallow copying.
``` ```suggestion
const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
``` ```suggestion
Use it with pure functions, avoid it when using functions making side effects.
``` Hey,
I did not notice that mustve been a prettier autoformatting

I think I might have replaced all of the first person pronouns. 

If it wasn't outside the scope of this PR, I would have totally capitalized ""npm"" and ""http"" and ""html"" and maybe change ""frontpage"" to ""front page"". And updated a few assertion methods. ","this part here if you had not found it yet ```suggestion
To implement server auto restarting on file save Node provides the `--watch` flag you can add to your start script `""start"": ""node --watch server.js""` or you can install a npm package like `nodemon`. This will be left to you as an exercise.
``` ```suggestion
You can respond to requests with a file using the `res.sendFile(path)` method. You can put it inside the `app.get('/', ...)` route handler. Behind the scenes, this method will set the appropriate headers to instruct your browser on how to handle the file you want to send, according to its type. Then it will read and send the file. This method needs an absolute file path. It's recommended that you use the Node global variable `__dirname` to calculate the path like this:
``` ```suggestion
As first thing you will create a simple API by creating a route that responds with JSON at the path `/json`. You can do it as usual, with the `app.get()` method. Inside the route handler, use the method `res.json()`, passing in an object as an argument. This method closes the request-response loop, returning the data. Behind the scenes, it converts a valid JavaScript object into a string, then sets the appropriate headers to tell your browser that you are serving JSON, and sends the data back. A valid object has the usual structure `{key: data}`. `data` can be a number, a string, a nested object or an array. `data` can also be a variable or the result of a function call, in which case it will be evaluated before being converted into a string.
``` ```suggestion
Now that you quickly reviewed the CSS box model, it's time to get started on the Rothko painting.
``` Okay I've removed reference to the advanced method.  I'm not quite happy with the phrasing. I wanna try ""The first thing you will create a simple API.."" It's missing the verb
```suggestion
A separate `styles.css` file has been created for you and the editor view has been switched to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.
``` ```suggestion
The first thing you will create is a simple API. Create a route that responds with JSON at the path `/json`. You can do it as usual, with the `app.get()` method. Inside the route handler, use the method `res.json()`, passing in an object as an argument. This method closes the request-response loop, returning the data.

In the following code, which value will color have if `--main-color` is not defined?

```css
p {
  color: var(--main-color, pink);
}
```
````

code fences need to be surrounded by empty lines and they need the language name to know which highlighting to use. please check your other code fences and fix this. Also anything code in the question needs to be in backticks. committed the change you suggested, is it fine now? You successfully fixed this issue, yes I'm not actually certain a user can set that in their browser. Unless I'm missing something, in which case provide a link so I can read up on it. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration 

 This doesn't seem quite right to me? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--* 

Can you explain?  What do you mean change change the DOM structure?  You're right that not all browsers have a direct setting for adjusting animation speed. However, many modern operating systems and browsers support a ""reduce motion"" option in their accessibility settings. This allows users to minimize or disable animations for a more comfortable experience.

You can also check user preferences with the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query in CSS. If a user has this setting enabled, you can adjust your animations accordingly.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion
https://web.dev/articles/prefers-reduced-motion yea i got your point..correcting the answer now it should be `--background-color: #333;` i appreciate your review...after i re read the question the most suitable answer seems to be `To define reusable styles across a project` not `to change the DOM Structure`  

fixing it now as well  ```suggestion
If you've declared a custom property for animation speed using `@property`, and a user adjusts their settings for animations in their browser, how would that affect your custom property? Would they be able to see the changes, or does it stick to the value you've set?
``` ```suggestion
The user's preferences will take priority, and they can adjust how the animations play out
``` ```suggestion
What's a key drawback when using CSS variables in combination with older layout models like `float` or `table`?
``` ```suggestion
The user's settings override your defined speed
``` isn't this the right answer? I am not sure this is the right answer this is true tho this is also true this is also true repeated question, please change it what's wrong with this one? it seems correct Shouldn't this be the correct answer? Shouldn't this be the correct answer? Shouldn't this be the correct answer? Shouldn't this be the correct answer? Shouldn't this be the correct answer? Shouldn't this be the correct answer? I wasn't able to find anything concrete regarding such drawbacks, could you link to some sources of this? There's previous very similar quesion:
> When defining a variable `--foreground` inside a media query, what happens when the media query no longer matches the current viewport?
> - The custom property is preserved and continues to apply
> - The custom property reverts to its initial value
> - The custom property is recalculated based on the viewport
> - The custom property is no longer available as it is scoped to the media query This is the same as correct answer, distractors must be different. There's already identical question used."

What does the `transform` CSS property allow you to do?
``` ```suggestion
Adjusts the brightness of the image, where `0%` makes it black and `100%` makes it white
``` ```suggestion
Changes the color balance of the image, where `0%` desaturates it and `100%` oversaturates it
``` ```suggestion
Alters the opacity of the image, where `0%` makes it transparent and `100%` makes it opaque
``` ```suggestion
Adjusts the contrast of the input image, where `0%` makes it grey, `100%` has no effect, and values over 100% increase contrast
``` ```suggestion
How is the `filter` property specified in CSS?
``` ```suggestion
As `block` or `inline`, with values expressed in pixels
``` ```suggestion
As `none` or multiple functions, but only percentage values are accepted
``` ```suggestion
As `none` or one or more functions, where percentage values can also be expressed as decimals
``` It's not technically true. While it changes the position in which the transformations take place, it's ultimate position is not changed. 

Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin#formal_definition A nitpick but by setting the opacity at 0%, you can turn an element invisible. And you can change the background color of an element with it too. And by increasing the contrast, it could seem smoother. "

@ilenia-magoni I just wanted to know if i should use ` ` for values as well. As you can see the above example in that options are values so should I put them as well inside the ` ` ? exactly those needs to go in backticks"

Well of navigator doesn't exist , I guess there is another way to tell if the page is Japanese.  Thank you, @a2937. I've always wanted this improvement!

However, it doesn't seem to be actually changing the font. I looked into the code a bit, and I could make it work by adding the following lines in `variables.css`, just below the `:root` rule:
```css
:root:lang(ja) {
  --font-family-sans-serif: 'Lato', 'NotoSansJapanese', sans-serif;
}
```

The Japanese font will look like this after the change:
![notojp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a4f162a-d80a-4054-9f5a-726028ed25b1)
 I still need to write a test for this. But I'm a little stumped on how to write one that will work with what we're doing here; and is globalization friendly.  For testing, I think it would make sense to create a unit test and mock env.json. That should let you create the default layout with and without the Japanese locale and confirm that it has the right font links each time. I've hit a road block. The test I wrote doesn't work in the slightest. The font elements are just missing.  >I've hit a road block. The test I wrote doesn't work in the slightest. The font elements are just missing.

Yeah, this is more involved than I thought. In principle we can setup Mock Service Worker, mock `window.matchMedia`, provide a user in response to the fetch request etc. etc.  It's a lot just to test if a font is used!

While I do think we should improve our client unit tests (and MSW would help with that), it's excessive for this particular feature. We should wait until we have time to improve the tests more generally. Thanks, but now I'm getting the following error when I switch the language to Japanese.¬†Do you get the same error on your end?

To change the language locally, update your `.env` file to use `japanese` for `CLIENT_LOCALE` and `CURRICULUM_LOCALE`. Then, run `pnpm run clean:client` and `pnpm run develop:client`. I was afraid of something weird like that happening. I removed the fragment and that seemed to have gotten things working again. We should rarely, if ever, be using loose equality. Thanks, one last thing. LGTM üëç Thank you so much for your work!","We should rarely, if ever, be using loose equality. Thanks, one last thing.

My hope is that the Japanese font files actually loaded.  I don't know how to dynamically change the navigator language and I was not aware of any existing tests in this repository that I can leverage for font testing. I will want to add one ideally before this gets merged.","```suggestion
    clientLocale === 'japanese' ? jpSansLightURL : latoLightURL;
``` ```suggestion
    clientLocale === 'japanese' ? jpSansRegularURL : latoRegularURL;
``` ```suggestion
  const boldFontUrl = clientLocale === 'japanese' ? jpSansBoldURL : latoBoldURL;
``` I'm sorry, I meant to add a separate rule for `:root:lang(ja)` after the `:root` rule block. This way, it shouldn't affect other languages.

GitHub don't let me add a suggestion for unchanged lines, but it should be:
```css
:root {
  ... /* Don't change these values */
}

:root:lang(ja) {
  --font-family-sans-serif: 'Lato', 'NotoSansJapanese', sans-serif;
}
```

This is especially important for Chinese because Japanese and Chinese share the same character code for different characters. If you use a Japanese font on Chinese text, it will display incorrect characters. Even if the language is Japanese, I would like Lato to be loaded too, so that English characters and numbers are displayed in Lato while other Japanese characters are displayed in NotoSansJP. Thanks for the updates.

Could you please insert these `<link>` tags for NotoSansJP only if the clientLocale is Japanese?

We always need Lato. And we additionally need NotoSansJP only for Japanese. ```suggestion
  const isJapanese = clientLocale === 'japanese';

Some of our tests are flaky because they have hidden race conditions. They were implicitly assuming that since a request has been made, it will have finished by the time the effect of the request is checked. This generally isn't much of a problem when the two servers are on the same machine, but it's pretty bad when they're not.

Will update it in next commit. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cac65320-eec7-4aae-b618-a40cbebe6ce0)
No, you really can just multiply the characters and let JS do the coercion. Thanks for pointing it out. Didn't know about coercion concept. Will replace the choice. Yes it does require rewording, I interpeted as ""compare how many times a letter appear in each string"" let's ask @naomi-lgbt if these questions that match labs or workshops can be kept or should be replaced the choices of these questions, there is multiple ones that are correct. You can reword the question to ask for the most efficient way maybe What's the question here? ```suggestion
Compare total number of letters in both strings.
```
Alternatively

```suggestion
Compare the length of both strings.
``` ```suggestion
Loop from `2` to up to the square root of the prime candidate, and make sure none of the number divides it evenly.
```
However I'd like the most checking if it's not divisible by `2` and then checking only odd numbers up to the square root. ```suggestion
Add the two numbers together and divide by `2`.
``` It might be good to include what would be the base case. I think writing to iterate string _twice_ might be a bit of exaggeration, considering the _almost_ full two iterations will happen only when non-repeating character is near the ending of string. I think this also could work. All other options are incorrect. but anyway, asking for best approach would be better."

- Update text to say you do not need to set the percentage for the first two colors.
- Added two tests that checks that the mention percentages for the first two colors are not set.
- Added a new line to make it easier to read the text.

---

Technically, if you set an incorrect percentage for either of the two first colors, you will still get the wrong hints. But at least this way you are warned if you set them to the two percentages mentioned in the text. I didn't really want to go the regex route, but I guess it's an option.

This is a fairly common issue on the forum, as I remember it.

","```suggestion
Within your `.keys` element, add seven `div` elements, each with the class `key`.
``` ```suggestion
Remember, a `class` attribute can hold multiple values. To differentiate between your white and black keys, add a second `class` value of `black--key` to your second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh `.key` elements.
``` ```suggestion
Now, copy the set of seven `.key` elements and paste two additional sets into the `.keys` div.
``` ```suggestion
Add a `link` element inside your `head` element. Set its `rel` attribute to `stylesheet` and its `href` attribute to `styles.css`.
``` ```suggestion
Browsers often apply default margin and padding values to specific elements. To make sure your piano layout displays correctly, you need to reset the box model.
``` ```suggestion
Now that you've reset the `html` box model, you need to apply this to the elements inside it as well. To do this, set the `box-sizing` property to `inherit`, which ensures that the targeted elements adopt the same value as their parent element.
``` ```suggestion
For now, create a CSS selector to target all elements using `*`, and include the pseudo-elements `::before` and `::after`. Set the `box-sizing` property to `inherit`.
``` ```suggestion
Now target your `#piano` element with an `id` selector. Set its `background-color` property to `#00471b`, the `width` property to `992px` and the `height` property to `290px`.
``` ```suggestion
Now it's time to use the pseudo-selectors you set up earlier. To create the black keys, add a new `.key.black--key::after` selector. This targets elements with both `key` and `black--key` classes and selects the pseudo-element created after these elements in the HTML.
``` ```suggestion
The `content` property is used to set or override the content of an element. By default, the pseudo-elements created by the `::before` and `::after` selectors are empty, which means they are not rendered on the page. By setting the `content` property to an empty string `""""`, you ensure that the pseudo-elements are rendered, while still appearing empty.
``` ```suggestion
To soften the sharp edges of the piano and its keys, start by giving the `#piano` a `border-radius` of `10px`.
``` ```suggestion
You may have noticed that the keys collapse when the browser window is smaller than `768px`. To address this issue, set `overflow` to `hidden` in the first `.keys` selector. This property will hide any elements that are pushed outside the defined `width` of `.keys`, preventing unwanted layout changes.
``` It might work better as Design a Piano. Or maybe Design a keyboard layout? I would go with ""Design a Piano"" but if you think the other option sounds better I'll trust you :+1:  @jdwilkin4  Yeah, Design a Piano works for me"

``` ```suggestion
Learn HTML fundamentals in these lecture videos.
``` I am not sure how I feel about casing for all of these titles.

Personally, I think we should go with only the first word starting with a capital letter and all other words as lowercase we are providing a transcript for all of these videos.
The transcripts will be pulled directly from the video itself since those recording might alter scripts once they start recording.

I think for now we should replace the answer the questions below with lorem ipsum since this will be eventually replace with the actual transcript    I feel like the wording here could be better clarified

maybe this?

```suggestion
What type of element is a `div`‚Äî inline, block, or inline-block?
``` for all mentions of id's in this file, it would be better to use all lowercase and have it wrapped in backticks instead of all caps Also, I fell like class should be in backticks too not sure if this hint is super helpful for a beginner.

maybe the hint could be updated to mention that there are to main sections in the html document (head and body) and which one would be best to contain meta data like character encoding? That's the structure we've always used for challenge titles. I think I am leaning towards keeping it like that - but could be convinced otherwise. I think the transcript will probably fit better somewhere else. Like below the videos. So it would be something like:
```
Watch the video and answer the questions below.
[video]
[transcript]
[questions]
```

","We might want a small paragraph here like ""Review the following concepts below to prepare for the quiz."" or something like that is there a way to conditionally update this text based on if it is a review page or not?

because for the review pages it won't make much sense to say check your answer

maybe, proceed to quiz instead? ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  I change it to just ""Submit"" for now, does that work? Yeah, submit works well here üëç  I know this is a common pattern in our code, but it's one we should avoid. If we want to memoize an expensive operation we should wrap _that_ in `createSelector`. If the selector just returns a value, there's no need to memoize.

Since `isChallengeCompletedSelector` does something expensive(ish), it might be worth `createSelector`ing in client/src/templates/Challenges/redux/selectors.js, but not here. Can we use the [object form](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch#defining-mapdispatchtoprops-as-an-object)? Less clutter. This would just become:

```ts
const mapStateToProps = (state: unknown) => ({
  isChallengeCompleted: isChallengeCompletedSelector(state) as boolean
});
``` ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
  const [assignmentsCompleted, setAssignmentsCompleted] = useState(0);
  const allAssignmentCompleted = assignmentsCompleted === assignments.length;
``` ```suggestion
  const handleAssignmentChange = (
    event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>
  ) => {
    const isCompleted = event.target.checked; // extract value before target is nullified
    setAssignmentsCompleted(a => (isCompleted ? a + 1 : a - 1));
  };
```
This is all we need. Bit out of scope, but there's no need to pass around the event. We can just pass `isCompleted` since that's all this function uses.  Are assignments optional? If so:
```suggestion
    if (assignments.length == 0 || allAssignmentsCompleted) {
```
otherwise it's impossible to open the completion modal when there are no assignments. ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  Should rename this to match the component Discussed a bit with Oliver.

Ideally, this should be handled by the component needing the tests. However, because not all components clean up old tests by themselves, this has to be done on any page change.

Ideally, whichever component needs tests also has a `useEffect(() => { return () => initTests([]) }, [])` cleanup function.

Until then, removing this here might have buggy consequences."

","```suggestion
Executing an app's most complex functionality.
``` Let's expand this into the full name. This one too. ```suggestion
If you have a complex function inside a component, which hook can you use to memoize its result?
```

Second-person preferred. ```suggestion
What is the `useCallback` hook?
``` ```suggestion
A hook that allows you to define a callback function.
``` ```suggestion
A custom hook not managed by React.
``` ```suggestion
A hook that checks an app's performance in development only.
``` ```suggestion
A hook that ensures a function isn't re-created each time a component re-renders.
``` ```suggestion
To abstract repetitive logic.
``` I think it's probably clearer if we provide some initial code to add more context.

````suggestion
Given the following code:

```jsx
const [certificates, setCertificates] = useState([]);
```

Which is the most reliable way to update array state using the `useState` hook?
````

`setCertificates('Front End');` is also a valid way to update state. So seeing `certificates` being an array would help rule this option out. There isn't a `setState` in the code, so mentioning it as a keyword could be confusing.

```suggestion
Arrow functions should not be used inside a state setter function.
``` ```suggestion
`previousState` must be spread before `name` to ensure any other properties are not overwritten.
``` The libraries can also be used in other ecosystems (Vue, Angular, etc.), so I think we should avoid putting them under the React umbrella.

```suggestion
Which of the following is NOT a state management library?
``` ```suggestion
What happens when the returned value of a `useRef` hook is updated?
``` ```suggestion
Which of the following lists only includes built-in React hooks?
``` ```suggestion
Controlled uses external API's, uncontrolled does not.
``` ```suggestion
Controlled is where component behaviors are driven by props, uncontrolled is where component behaviors are driven by local state.
```

React have slightly changed the definitions of controlled and uncontrolled components.

Old:

> In most cases, we recommend using [controlled components](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

New:

> Uncontrolled components are easier to use within their parents because they require less configuration. But they‚Äôre less flexible when you want to coordinate them together. Controlled components are maximally flexible, but they require the parent components to fully configure them with props.
>
> In practice, ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and ‚Äúuncontrolled‚Äù aren‚Äôt strict technical terms‚Äîeach component usually has some mix of both local state and props. However, this is a useful way to talk about how components are designed and what capabilities they offer.
>
> When writing a component, consider which information in it should be controlled (via props), and which information should be uncontrolled (via state).

 ```suggestion
Single-page applications don't actually use a single page for routing.
``` There isn't a `feedback` variable in the provided code. I'm not sure the intention of this question: to test if campers know how `useEffect` behaves given the dependency array, or to test if campers know how React executes the code in dev environment.

The ""in production"" part and the ""Twice due to strict mode."" option make me think it's the latter. And if so, I'd suggest not forming the question this way.

The render-twice behavior is good to know, but only if campers have to setup and run a React app locally. And up until this point, I don't think campers are asked to do that; campers can run their React code directly in the browser.

I think the question can just be `How many times will this code print to the console?`. And the ""Twice due to strict mode."" option should be changed to something else.
 I'm not sure if this is a random word or it's referring to https://www.picklejs.com/. 

Knowing the JS world, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a Pickle library for state management in the future. So to future-proof, we should change the answer to something more concrete, say ""NodeJS"" or ""jQuery"". ```suggestion
setCertificates(previousItems => ...previousItems, ""Front End"");
```

let's use double quotes for JSX to be uniform with the rest of the curriculum ```suggestion
setCertificates(""Front End"");
``` ```suggestion
setCertificates().append(""Front End"");
``` ```suggestion
setCertificates(previousItems => [...previousItems, ""Front End""]);
``` ```suggestion
    name: ""Discovery""
``` ```suggestion
  console.log(| Nice work!!"");
``` ```suggestion
The `react-router-dom` library is a popular choice to handle routing in React apps.

```
let's not remove EOF empty lines ```suggestion
  console.log(""Nice work!!"");

    ""note"": ""Your exam token is a secret key that allows you to access exams. Do not share this token with anyone."",
``` Shall we change these errors to `string | null`?

That is clearer than string or empty string. We will need some way to link directly to this section of the page. Maybe.

```suggestion
    <FullWidthRow id='exam-environment-authorization-token'>
``` ```suggestion
      const {
        data: {
          data: { examEnvironmentAuthorizationToken }
        }
      } = response;
      setExamToken(examEnvironmentAuthorizationToken);
``` This never throws, because everything is in a `try...catch`.

So, we should either handle the error here, or not catch anything. Is there a way to let Campers know why the button is disabled? Ordinarily, I would not worry, but with a timeout of 10s, it might be nice to have something like a tooltip saying ""You too recently generated an exam token. Wait 10 seconds before trying again"". Yes, but Eslint gets angy.  We could show a message: Please wait a moment to generate a new token.

I am fine with adding that. Now I think of it, it's not very accessibility friendly at the moment.  found a way! ```suggestion
```
We might as well inline this, since it's just two lines quite descriptive code. Also, it's not a debounce, it's just a temporary delay. ```suggestion
    setRecentlyGenerated(true);
    setTimeout(() => setRecentlyGenerated(false), 10000);
``` I would either use `null` consistently to mean ""no error"" or use  `''` instead of `null`. Mixing the two is confusing. ```suggestion
```
We don't need this. Either we have an `examToken`, in which case we show the modal, or we don't, in which case we don't. ```suggestion
        open={!!examToken}
``` ```suggestion
          setExamToken(null);
``` ```suggestion
            onClick={() => void getToken()}
``` ```suggestion
              setExamToken(null);

let's not remove EOF empty line Please review this:

Now you need to log the value of ` entryDropdown.value` , it will output the currently selected value from the dropdown list. Here's how it works:

The `<select>` element has multiple `<option>` elements, each with a value attribute (like ""breakfast"", ""lunch"", ""dinner"" etc.).
By default, the selected option is ""Breakfast"" because it has the selected attribute.
If you log entryDropdown.value, it will return the value of the currently selected <option>

Initially, this will log ""breakfast"", but as the user interacts with the dropdown, it will log the value of the currently selected option. add it in the PR please I'll do that, first I want to confirm is this correct or any changes needed? Please add it to the PR, it is easier to review ```suggestion
--fcc-editable-region--
``` ```suggestion

```
Why is there so much empty space here? No it won't. The whole point of this is to show that the value in the global state is only captured once. is this the correct description : 

Now you need to log the value of `entryDropdown.value`, you'll get the currently selected option from the dropdown. Here's how it works:

As the `entryDropdown.value` in a static context (outside of an event listener), it will display the value at the time of code execution, which will not update dynamically as the user interacts with the dropdown.

So here it will capture the initial value (in this case, ""breakfast""), and it won't update if the user changes the selection later. ```suggestion
assert.notMatch(code, /console\.log\s*\(.*\)/)
``` done ```suggestion
It will capture the initial value (in this case, `""breakfast""`) and won't reflect any changes the user makes afterward.
``` The explanation is good, but the instructions of adding the console.log is missing. Something like:

```suggestion
Now you need to retrieve the value of `entryDropdown.value` to get the currently selected option from the dropdown. 

Print `entryDropdown.value` to the console to see its value.

Since `entryDropdown.value` is in a static context (outside of an event listener), it only shows the value at the moment the code runs. This means it won't automatically update as the user interacts with the dropdown.

It will capture the initial value (in this case, `""breakfast""`) and won't reflect any changes the user makes afterward.

```
I think Chakra, or some other actual engine, makes more sense here. Unless it is intentional that we use something that isn't an engine. This distractor is the same as the answer. Not sure if this is relevant to a Node/Express quiz. Same as with Deno. Technically, Mongoose is an ODM. Again, I'm not sure different Runtimes are really relevant to this quiz. It is about Node and Express. As already said, it isn't about DBs. Deno and Bun are within the topics listed in the issue, so I guess they are fine? there will be probably, you can start fixing with this feedback ```suggestion
`req.data`

```

let's not remove empty lines I guess so. Just seems a little odd to me if the quiz is about Node and Express. Yeah, I got your point. I will make the required changes I know the first point in the issue says

> JavaScript runtimes and engines (V8, node, deno, bun, browsers)

But that is super broad, questions about the browser seems completely unrelated to Node and Express.

I would much prefer a Node or Express question here. How about asking how you start an express server.

Feels like a subjective thing. The idea is that it will highlight all links on the page. Compared to other options this seems unnecessary. Also, if a developer does want a formatting in all the links, they can do so in simpler ways. 

Although on a second thought, this can have a use-case since all links may not be http.

I'll change this question. Hello, I have replaced this question with a new one. ```suggestion
How would you target all `<input>` elements with an `id` attribute that ends with `""field""`?
``` ```suggestion
How would you style `<a>` elements where the `title` attribute starts with `""Read""`?
``` Would this not target button elements that have no `data-tooltip` at all? fixed this issue.

","We need both, right? Most of the lessons just have a single question. Is the question code going to be replaced by QuizQuestion components? If so, :+1:  The UI doesn't support this suggestion, but:

```ts
    this.setState(state => ({
      selectedMcqOptions: state.selectedMcqOptions.map((option, index) =>
        index === questionIndex ? answerIndex : option
      )
    }));
```
This is a bit neater, imo, but the main thing is that any `setState` that depends on existing state should use the callback. Otherwise state updates can get lost when React batches them. Nit, but I recommend just using `_.isEqual` so we don't have to have yet another tiny util. ```suggestion
      allAssignmentsCompleted: assignments.length == 0,
``` Same point as above - we don't need to reinvent `isEqual`. Again, I'd use a map and we need to use the `(state) =>...` form. ```suggestion
                <React.Fragment key={answerIndex}>
```
The fragment needs the key (since it's the wrapping element) ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
                </React.Fragment>
``` Hopefully ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  ‚úÖ  I am struggling to see a reason for such a weird type. That is, why not go with `number[]`? they start out as `null[]` with a length of the number of questions - I suppose undefined might be more appropriate. But yea, so the selected options are all unselected when you go to the challenge, then when you select an option, it changes the index of that selected option to the selection - the others are still null. Select an option for all the questions, and then there isn't any more nulls for the `selectedOptions` - click ""check your answers"" and those options get copied to the `submittedAnswers` - so we know what they last submitted and show the feedback. From there, they can change any answers and try to submit again. Maybe get it running and give it a try to see the UX if you haven't.

So, I guess we could do something like store all those as -1 to start instead of null? It feels like null or undefined is more appropriate. Any suggestions? Right, I understand what is going on. I just think it is odd to do that instead of storing an array of ids (indexes) of just the selected stuff.  So, I think I need some clarification still. You don't know why the `submittedMcQAnswers` exists? or you don't like the type `selectedMcqOptions: (number | null)[];` - if it's the second, I'm not understanding how I could just store an arrays of id's. Can you give me an example of what that would look like? For some more clarification on my end, the array currently stores the selected option index in the array at the index of the question. So if you had three MCQ questions, the array might look like this: `[2, 1, null]` - meaning the currently selected option for question 1 is answer 2, question 2 is answer 1, and question 3 doesn't have a selected option yet.

The ""check your answers"" button is not disabled if an answer isn't selected, so you can submit something with `null` - perhaps that's not the way to go, but that's how it currently works. So I left it like that. Ah. That was a misunderstanding on my part. Thank you.

I suppose it does work to have it with that type."

``` This question is bugging me for two reasons. Regression testing does seem like a valid answer since it is running tests to ensure code changes did not break existing functionality. 

The second reason is that it's technically automated testing being ran in GitHub Actions workflow, but the prompt did specifically say ""Automated tests on GitHub"". 

Source for Regression testing : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-regression-testing/ 

Source on building a GitHub Actions workflow for testing: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-net

Edit: The official name uses a ""H"" so it will need some kind of change regardless.  I've seen Jenkins in action and it does certainly does allow builds to be automated , tested, and deployed.  I agree question feels a bit off. It ask about _practice involving automatically running tests_ and answer is _Automated tests_. About the first concern, the question is specifically asking about the practice of automatically running tests when code changes are pushed, which is a broader concept than just regression testing as for the second one I agree that the answer provided is very specific.  I think switching the answer to Continuous Integration or just 'Automated tests'.

Or another thing we can do is change the question a bit to ""Which CI/CD practice involves automatically running tests whenever code changes are pushed to a repository?""

Please lemme know which would be the better option. Ok I will change it Let's see. 

""Which CI/CD practice involves automatically running tests whenever code changes are pushed to a repository?"" 

A proper answer might be something like ""Continuous Testing"".

How about calling it `mixed` for now? I've marked `blockLayout` as optional. This PR will just be scoped to making client support the `blockLayout` property.

I'll add the property to the blocks' meta.json files when the new UI is ready. Otherwise, the UI will be inconsistent.

#56090 makes all workshop blocks render in grid layout, but we only want that layout for HTML, CSS, and JS blocks (backend workshops should still render as a list).

This PR adds support for a `blockLayout` property in `meta.json`. We will use this property to determine which layout type a block should be rendered in.

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","The current block names are _very_ confusing to me. So I... renamed them.

Mapping:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| Block | ChallengeListBlock |
| ProjectBlock | ProjectListBlock |
| GridBlock | ChallengeGridBlock |
| ProjectGridBlock | LinkBlock |

I wanted the names to describe what the component would display (grid, list, link, etc.) rather than their purpose (challenge, project, etc.). But it's pretty hard to do that with the existing implementation, and the list above is the best I could do.

I think in the future (when we move/build components in fcc/ui, to share with CAP), we could have the following block components:
- Grid
- List
  - There are two *List components in the list above, but the `ProjectListBlock` one is very similar to `ChallengeListBlock`. We can just group them into a single `List` component and provide props to customize the elements displayed
- Link
- GridAndList / Mixed I'd love some advice here.

I've been building the FED super block UI by cloning `block.tsx` and tweaking it. So `blockLayout` is only needed for those FED components, and the missing of `blockLayout` in other super blocks won't cause them to break.

Though I think we will eventually need to have `blockLayout` in all meta files, so I guess we should do it now when we still remember? > I wanted the names to describe what the component would display (grid, list, link, etc.) rather than their purpose (challenge, project, etc.).

:100: I really dislike the tendency to name things according to how they're used, rather than what they are. Maybe. Would it be terrible to make `blockLayout` optional and then check for it in the client?"

This PR:
- Changes the approach of visually hiding input elements on the exam page. The current implementation approach uses `position: absolute` and `left: -9999px`, making the elements out of view and resulting a test failure as Playwright is not able to locate the elements. The fix here is to use the existing `sr-only` class, which only adjusts the elements' styles and not position.
- Unblocks #51798 which requires querying and interacting with the input elements.
- Is similar to #51743.

But the ""user not signed in"" case has been failing in CI.

I'm not able to debug locally so I can't be sure, but my theory is:
- Before each test, we run the `global-setup.ts` file to log the user in
- In the above-mentioned test case, we want to log the user out
- The test failed because the user hasn't logged out in time when Playwright accesses the page, and thus the redirect we expect didn't happen

Though if this is the case, I would expect a race condition and a flaky test. I'll update this PR once https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/54633 is in. Hopefully that would resolve the authentication issue in the tests.Tests passed locally but failed in CI. I'll dig deeper ü•≤

    setEmailValue(event.target.value);
```
It is a string, so we can keep this simple. ```suggestion
  const emailValidationState = maybeEmailRE.test(emailValue)
    ? isEmail(emailValue)
      ? 'success'
      : 'error'
    : null;
```
It seems strange to make this a function when it's so simple and just derived from the state. ```suggestion
                  validationState={emailValidationState}
``` ```suggestion
                  disabled={emailValidationState !== 'success'}
``` ```suggestion
    await page.waitForURL(/\/learn\/?/);
```
I'm in two minds about this if this is an improvement, but it is a little more concise :shrug:  CI failed here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/actions/runs/9642563053/job/26592023962?pr=54128.

On /settings, the Claim Certification buttons are rendered as links, but since this is an action, button should be a more appropriate element.

","Previously, the rendering logic is:
- If the Full Stack cert is claimable (meaning the user has completed 6 other certs)
  - If the user has claimed the cert, render a ""Show cert"" link
  - If the user has not claimed the cert, render a ""Claim cert"" link
  - Both links have an `onClick`. And If the link is ""Claim cert"", `onClick` will execute some additional logic for the action
- If the Full Stack cert is not claimable (meaning the user has not completed 6 other certs), render a ""Claim cert"" button and disable it
 I'm now changing the logic to:
- If the user has claimed the Full Stack cert:
  - Render a ""Show cert"" link, without an `onClick`
- If the user hasn't claimed the Full Stack cert:
  - Render a ""Claim cert"" button with an `onClick`, and disable the button if the Full Stack cert isn't claimable Same thing here, but for normal certs."

In this case, I don't think MDN is giving you all of the options for managing focus in a modal dialog. You don't have to place the focus on an element in the dialog, you can place it on the dialog itself. Oh, actually, I just checked, and the [MDN page for the dialog element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog#accessibility) does actually suggest this.

I'm apparently not smart enough to trigger these modals so I can't give you my opinion on where focus should be placed. I just wanted to let you know that it doesn't have to be on either of these buttons. Thanks @bbsmooth!

You can open the modal manually in the local environment by setting `open={true}`:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/6faca2af885f3b2c39cd18554732639102c3e6f9/client/src/components/Donation/donation-modal.tsx#L68

But if you're on production, you can trigger the modal by completing three challenges.

--- 

There is also a guide that W3 provides: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/. The doc says we can even place the focus on the text content, rather than a focusable element. But I wasn't sure if that's the case here, since the context is clear enough.

> If the dialog content includes semantic structures, such as lists, tables, or multiple paragraphs, that need to be perceived in order to easily understand the content, i.e., if the content would be difficult to understand when announced as a single unbroken string, then it is advisable to add `tabindex=""-1""` to a static element at the start of the content and initially focus that element. This makes it easier for assistive technology users to read the content by navigating the semantic structures. Additionally, it is advisable to omit applying `aria-describedby` to the dialog container in this scenario. 
 Thanks for the pr. I might need to AB test this to make sure it does not have any unintended side effects.
But the active state of the donation button came to my attention. It seems like we should either completely remove these or make them more subtle. 

I am leaning towards completey removing them similar to the paypal button. What do you think?




 @ahmaxed Thank you for the feedback.

I made the following changes:
- When the second part of the modal shows up, focus on the benefit list (by setting `tabIndex={-1}`) instead of the donate button
  - Now that I'm visiting this behavior again, I think putting the focus on the donate button might be perceived as a dark pattern (you know, conveniently placing the focus on the button that starts a subscription) even though that's not our intention.
- Removed the styles of focus and active states from the donate button. On focus, the button will just have a focus outline.

I tested the Paypal and Stripe buttons on production, and found that their focus state are different:

<details>
  <summary>Image</summary>

| Paypal | Stripe |
| --- | --- |
| <img width=""695"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 06 41 49"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/181bb4ce-ba5b-4062-b990-01bb18339701""> | <img width=""698"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 06 41 59"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76ecbf8e-f647-4b32-8e5c-7d3491a3a2ae""> |

</details>

It looks like the Paypal button should be updated to match the Stripe one, but I'm not sure if the differences are intentional or not. I'll need your help with the fix here if it's needed, I tried adding Paypal credentials to `.env` but I wasn't able to get the button show up on the screen. The paypal should look similar to patreon as you mentioned. Some of that styles are coming through paypal's iframe.
Feel free to keep the changes introduced in this pr behind a11y-donation-modal flag. I will monitor it for a while to see if it affects donation at all. 

 Okay, I've moved the close-on-escape behavior and the focus on BenefitList behind the `a11y-donation-modal` flag.

I couldn't figure out how to fix the Paypal button focus styles (it doesn't seem to be customizable). The focus state of the ones in [their doc](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/multiparty/checkout/standard/customize/buttons-style-guide/) look much better than ours, but I don't know why there is a difference. @ahmaxed if you know how to fix this, please help üòÖ  Getting the following error for the variation with the new feature:

This PR updates the donation modal to:
- Allow closing the modal by pressing Escape when the animation is complete
- Automatically focus on the donate button when the second part appears
  - There are two buttons on the modal: ""Become a Supporter"" and ""Ask me later"". The a11y recommendation is to have keyboard focus placed on a default focusable element in the modal. Generally the initial focus is set on the first focusable element, but we're free to decide what should receive the focus. I chose the ""Become a Supporter"" button because it's the first focusable element, but I'm open to suggestions here.
  - Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role#required_javascript_features

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","We can just create the button ref internally in the `Benefits` component body. But since `BecomeASupporterConfirmation` is the outermost component of the modal's second part, and we have buttons in other components as well (`CloseButtonRow`), I thought the focus management should be kept in this layer so that it's easier to follow.

I'm not sure if I'm overthinking here and we should just move the focus management into `Benefits` instead. Under the hood, `Modal` calls `onClose` when the Esc key is pressed. `handleModalHide` previously didn't trigger the close action so the keypress was ignored. 
Wouldn't the following be more straightforward. 
```suggestion
    if (isA11yFeatureEnabled && canClose ) {
              closeDonationModal();
    }

https://web.dev/articles/inp

---

BTW, I'm out of the loop on these quizzes. What is the knowledge base they are founded upon?

Is it answers to questions we have given at some point in the curriculum, or just stand-alone quizzes with no direct connection to the curriculum? @lasjorg It's for the new curriculum, the lectures are WIP right now @naomi-lgbt @ilenia-magoni Do you want me to add a question on Interaction to Next Paint (INP), or are these questions good enough? @ilenia-magoni Then let me rephrase it, how does the camper know the answers?

Surely it isn't expected that challenges will be created that contain answers to all the questions asked? That would cause the quizzes to dictate the challenge content. @lasjorg the lectures should contain the knowledge needed for the quizzes. If we need changes later on we can always do changes. The issues were specifically created to encourage Hacktoberfest contributions. @ilenia-magoni OK, just seems a little backwards to me. But I get the motivation. @AryanBhirud 

If you want to add one question on INP that is fine.

If you are already at 20 questions, then you will need to replace one of these questions with the INP one because each quiz should have a max of 20 questions. @jdwilkin4 I have replaced one of the questions with a new one on INP. Awaiting review.",,"Checklist:

Then, make at least 11 requests to the api. A `api/logs/` directory should be populated with `jsonl` files.

Eventually, we can build out tooling for using the `jsonl` files such as:
- Set the database to the same state as needed when the original request came in
- Compare database states before/after same request
- Re-running the requests at the same rate they were originally made
- Re-running the requests as fast as possible
- Compare relative handler times","```suggestion

Why not this? Because, if we want to try capture 100's of requests and look at their timings, a lack of a buffer would significantly affect the results.

_""One does not simply know both the data and performance of a request, without using a buffer.""_ - Werner Heisenberg, 1927 [slightly modified] Yes, but then I would have to learn what lodash offers. Sure, but this displaces the problem, rather than solving it. With this approach you get all the delay at once.

I don't know why the timing matters, exactly, but isn't that worse? Isn't it obvious from the names and the context?"

In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: `<div></div>`; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called ‚Äúvoid elements‚Äù, or tags that don‚Äôt require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.
``` ```suggestion
External CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML‚Äôs opening and closing `<head>` tags with a `<link>` element (which is a void element and doesn't require a closing tag):
``` ```suggestion
First, you add a `<link>` tag inside of the opening and closing `<head>` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you‚Äôll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In the example above, you are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.
``` ```suggestion
There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements often look like this: `<br />` or `<img/>`, but some can also be used without the closing forward slash such as `<br>` or `<img>`. These are known as void elements or empty elements because they don‚Äôt wrap any content. You will encounter a few of these in later lessons, but for the most part, elements will have both opening and closing tags.
``` ```suggestion
Why are void elements like `<br/>` or `<img>` essential in HTML?
``` ```suggestion
To display an image in HTML you use the `<img>` element. Unlike the other elements you have encountered, the `<img>` is a void element. Empty, void HTML elements do not need a closing tag.

```` ```suggestion
By adding a `?` after the parameter name

``` Fixed it. Thanks for pointing it out. Not exactly sure what is meant by, implementing a class?
If it is referring to the use of `extends` could we be more explicit about it? ```suggestion
Checks all code paths in a function to ensure they return a value.
```
Might be a worthwhile distinction to add.

All functions implicitly return `undefined` and you can implicitly/explicitly have `undefined` as the return type, and Typescript will let the function ""bottom out"" without an explicit return.

Works
```
function isTrue(test: boolean) {
  if (test) {
    console.log(""true"");
  } else {
    return undefined;
  }
  console.log(""Bottom"");
}
isTrue(true);
```
Doesn't work
```
function isTrue(test: boolean) {
  if (test) {
    console.log(""true"");
  } else {
    return false;
  }
  console.log(""Bottom"");
}
isTrue(true);
``` Thanks for pointing it out. I should've phrased that better.
What I meant was that classes can implement interfaces or Interfaces can be used to declare class implementations.

Thanks again
 Got it. Learnt something new today.

","Excuse me. I have a question about this question. You see I don't understand it. What criteria are you using to judge whether or not something is a static file type? Now I understand ASP.NET and Node.js aren't file types. But why is HTML chosen as a proper answer over PHP?  Hi Anna, 
The criteria to judge whether or not something is a static file type in that question is static files are delivered to the client exactly as they are stored on the server, without undergoing any server-side processing or modification.
That's why, HTML is chosen as a static file over PHP because HTML is served as it is, while PHP requires server-side execution to generate content.
hope this clarifies your query! Just as an aside, Candidate Recommendation is in the process of being changed.

","Wouldn't `while` loop be worse for iterating over array? Technically `return` also can break loop, if it's in function üòõ  ```suggestion
3,5,7,9,11,13
``` ```suggestion
How many times code below will output the `in the loop`?
```
It's hard to show the _infinite_ output. Perhaps question should ask for the number of times it's outputed instead. Distractors and answer would need to be updated. Actually, it isn‚Äôt. In terms of performance, the while loop iterates over the array using its index, whereas the for‚Ä¶in loop looks for the properties of the array to iterate over it leading to more computing time compared to the while loop.

Also, there are rare cases where the for‚Ä¶in can give unpredictable results, whereas that is not the case for the while loop ActuallyüòÇ. I was majorly focusing on loops and that did not come to mind. I will put a different option there Have addressed this comment
 Comment has been addressed Comment has been addressed Leaving performance, or edge cases aside. For me problem with `while` loop is the need for manual setting up condition, incrementing array index. More places where error can sneak up. `for...in` despite of having downsides prevents such error by definition.  you can click on ""resolve conversation"" if the comment has been addressed Okay. I understand. Is it better I change this question or I use while loop as the answer?
 I'd at least change the answer. If you have idea for another question, or clarifying in question what to take under consideration when judging specific loop types, that also would be good. Went with the first suggestion. Thank you ```suggestion

 ```suggestion
Which of the following is not an iterable object?

 ```suggestion
Which of the following is not a type of loop supported in JavaScript?
```
 ```suggestion

    # Numbers are immutable
``` Haha üòÖ  Thank you. Honestly, I am pretty sure I know some of this stuff üôÉ 

None of this will be in the final project, but I keep it in this `final.md` file for reference as I develop. I think `str` is a built-in class. Usually modules require import. ```suggestion
3. If the sum of all the digits is a multiple of 10, then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
```
Hope it is clearer. Just to be consistent: should I change the part on how to access characters in a string in the first project and mention `[]` as the index operator? I'd avoid to call `print` a statement since the `print` statement in Python 2 has been replaced by the print function.
```suggestion
Remove the `print()` call from the `verify_card_number` function.
``` ```suggestion
You should not have a `print()` call within the `verify_card_number` function.
``` ```suggestion
Remove the `print()` call from the `main` function.
``` ```suggestion
You should not have a `print()` call within the `main` function.
``` Since `string[start:end:step]` won't be translated, I think a brief explanation is necessary.
The example below might be fine but it should include `end` too. 
Maybe something like:
```py
my_string = 'camperbot'
camper = my_string[0:6]
cp = my_string[0:6:3]
```
Saying that the default `end` value is 1? ```suggestion
Use a `for` loop to iterate over each digit in the `odd_digits` list. Move your `print()` call from the previous step into the `for` loop, and change it to print each digit.
``` ```suggestion
Convert the `digit` variable to an integer before adding it to `sum_of_odd_digits`. Then, move the `print` call to the end of the `verify_card_number` function to print the value of `sum_of_odd_digits`.
``` ```suggestion
Below your `print` call, create a variable named `sum_of_even_digits` and assign it a value of `0`.
``` ```suggestion
You should have `sum_of_even_digits = 0` below your `print` call.
``` ```suggestion
Remove the `print` call for the sum of the odd digits.
``` ```suggestion
Within the even digit `for` loop, replace the `print` call with a variable named `number` and assign it the value of `digit` multiplied by `2`.
``` ```suggestion
Move the `print` call below the `number` reassignment.
``` ```suggestion
Outside of the `if` statement, add `number` to `sum_of_even_digits`, and remove the `print` call.
``` ```suggestion
As a final step, remove the `print` call from the `verify_card_number` function, and change the `card_number` back to something valid.
``` ```suggestion
You should have `print(""INVALID!"")` within the `else` clause.
```
Following Estefania's suggestion. Thank you. Definitely That is a good point. We might be better with common notation, then: `[x:y:h]`. Good point. Thank you. I don't have wording suggestion for this, but instead of adding what later can be done with it (that's in the next step), maybe just focus on how the resulting dictionary looks like - _unicode ordinal of key character_ -> _character_ ```suggestion
Create a variable called `translated_card_number` and assign it the result of calling `translate` method on `card_number` with `card_translation` as an argument.
``` ```suggestion
You should have `--fcc-expected--` within the `for` loop.
```
Print is already included in the expected value. I kind of did this in previous step (wrote the reassignment above the `print`). If there's some clever way to direct camper to do it below print, without simply forcing the order in previous step, it could be a good idea. Nitpicking :eyes: - there's no `print` outside of the `if`."

**MERGE/DEPLOY AFTER:** https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53511","Should we check if the GH link is a valid URL here too? The comment above this says, `` `solution` needs to exist, but does not have to be valid URL`` - this appears to check that it is valid. Just want to make sure that's intended.

This seemed a little verbose.  Why do we need the log? No idea. We probably don't. If `!isURL(githubLink + '')` is converting to a string, could we not `!isUrl(String(githubLink))`? Yep, that works too. I'm not sure there's a strong reason to prefer either one. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I have no idea about the log, but it was in all the others. So, I left it."

Also, 100ms doesn't seem like much wiggle room if this is caused by a slow running test. Right. I can see how moving it forward could decrease the millisecond difference. But I'm also not quite sure how much more of a buffer this needs. The original test was off by an amount that could be covered by an extra one hundred milliseconds. Prior to this, one whole second was the buffer.  It seems fairly unlikely a camper would write code that unintentionally is incorrectly off by just a few seconds. It will either be close or plain wrong. Allowing for 2 or even 3 seconds of difference doesn't seem like such a big deal.",,"Checklist:

These changes allow us to poll Algolia for the number of records in an index (English, Spanish, and so on), then create an ignored `search-bar.json` translation file with a predetermined placeholder. This dynamically generated placeholder will be either the default text ""Search our tutorials"", or ""Search our <num>+ tutorials"", depending on several conditions.

1. If the Algolia keys are set in the `.env` file and the target language's `translation.json` file is synced with these changes:
  - The generated / ignored `search-bar.json` file should contain either `{ ""placeholder"": ""Search our tutorials"" }` or `{ ""placeholder"": ""Search {{ roundedTotalRecords }}+ tutorials"" }`
  - If the target index has > 100 records the placeholder should be `""Search our tutorials""`
  - If the target index has >= 100 records the placeholder should be `""Search our <num>+ tutorials""`

2. If the Algolia keys are not set in the `.env` file / there's a network issue, and the target language's `translation.json` file has been synced with these changes:
  - The generated / ignored `search-bar.json` file should contain `{ ""placeholder"": ""Search our tutorials"" }`
  - The placeholder should use the default placeholder, which is currently `""Search our tutorials""` for English

3. If the Algolia keys are set in the `.env` file / there's a network issue, but the target language's `translation.json` file hasn't been synced with these changes:
  - The generated / ignored `search-bar.json` file should contain either `{ ""placeholder"": ""search.placeholder.default"" }` or `{ ""placeholder"": ""search.placeholder.numbered"" }`
  - The placeholder should fallback to the current placeholder in the `translation.json` file (`t(search.placeholder)`), which is currently `""–®—É–∫–∞—Ç–∏ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫–∞—Ü—ñ–π""` for another language like Ukrainian

Note: So far I haven't figured out a way to do localized builds like Spanish or Japanese to make sure the fallbacks work for other languages. The build fails due to missing dictionaries. If anyone could walk me though the process of setting those up, or do a couple of localized builds on your end, that'd be great.",

The way forward is probably to create a self-contained testing module that we can feed in tests and get out results, but it's tricky to impose that structure on such a messy application. The best solution I can think of would be to create a specialized set of curriculum files specifically made to test if all of our functionality works.

I'm proposing this change because I don't think there is any reason to require the balls to be returned in a specific order.","```suggestion
        actual = sorted(hat.draw(20))
        expected = sorted(['yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'red', 'green', 'green', 'green', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'test'])
```
`sort` method sorts in-place and returns `None`.

There are other tests checking what `draw` method returns. Shouldn't they as well check contents after sorting?  It may be that other tests may work as expected because the extraction result is determined by the seed, I have never seen issues with those

in the case of this one the drawn balls can be in the same order as hat.contents or they can be randomly ordered, and it was against the freedom of implementing the output as one wants

Colour transparency is managed by the alpha channel, the `opacity` property affects the entire element(s) targeted by the selector. These answers are not code and do not need to be in backticks. Inherit does not set the value to the browser default. It sets the value to the computed value of the parent element. Which can sometimes be the default value, but not always. ```suggestion

The cookie clearing function, for instance, still needs to know about the CSRF plugin's internals, so it's not perfectly encapsulated, but it does clean up the main app a touch. The improved modularity also makes for easier and more focused testing (we don't have to work around CSRF protect if, say, we want test error handling).

If we had a high-level terminology document, like we do for Workshop, Lecture, Lab and the like, then it shouldn't be too hard to disentangle these concepts.

**NOTE:** Merging will break `exam-env` and `exam-creator` build","Since we don't get to play with intervals, maybe use milliseconds here? That way it's consistent with Date and we don't need to convert between the two. Could you explain why not? It's not clear from context why this is special. Should this be `QuestionGroup` or maybe `QuestionCategory`? It doesn't seem right to have `type` be a property of type. ```suggestion
type MultipleChoice {
```
Or MultipleChoiceQuestion? ""New"" isn't very descriptive. ```suggestion
type Audio {
```
It doesn't seem to be new. Why float? An integer no. of milliseconds seems more natural. Should this be a relation? DateTime? DateTime again? It seems weird to suddenly be using snake case for properties. It's better to be consisent, imo. Shouldn't this be ""is staging"" or have its own env var? This is a WIP? `text` is very generic. What is this for? It seems a little strange to separate out these exam properties from the rest. i.e. name and accessibility_note seem as much part of config as these. Yes, ignore the tests. I stopped writing tests when I realised I was changing the schema twice per week. It is the text for the overall question type.

I did not want to call it `question_type_text`. No, but I wanted it clear this was related to the `NewExam` and not the `Exam`. No specific reason expect that is the format we use it everywhere. So, using milliseconds would mean everywhere would need to convert to a float of seconds. Good point. I am not sure how to write that relation?

`exam.question_types[].tags` can be a subset of `exam.config.tags[].set`. Or, `exam.config.tags[].set` can be a subset of `exam.question_types[].tags`.

So, all of `exam.config.tags[].set` must be in the union of `exam.question_types.tags`. Why complicate the type for the same amount of info? `DateTime` in Prisma maps to `Timestamp` in Mongodb, which is just a complicated _""Current time since epoch in seconds""_. I asked you if it should have its own env var, and you said ""no"", because `FREECODECAMP_NODE_ENV` perfectly suits the bill. That is nicer, assuming we move away from the `New___` prefix. Maybe `QuestionCategory`, but that does not _ring as well with me_ as `QuestionType`. I could, but, now, I cannot üòÖ 

I clearly had a good reason for this at some point, but it has escaped me. Sure, we could go with milliseconds. If we really want to, we can.

You just want to change as much of the schema as possible, don't you! I might have, but nonetheless: why only in development? Isn't the plan to put this on staging first? Right, but ""text"" is implied because it's a string! What kind of text is it? A description? A name? It's a bit verbose, but I think most of the News can become MultipleChoices."

 This is the behaviour @ahmaxed suggested. We might be able to change it to something different.



 I completely understand. We have similar forums on modal on learn and this pattern reflects what others such as Linkedin is doing. Maybe it needs a bit getting used to.

 Here are a few notes (some might be un related):
- The project cards should have an edit button of their own: [mock](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/48234#issuecomment-1838175064)
-  The button should preferably be the icon itself.
-  The icon could be changed to 'faPen'.
-  The icon button should be as tall as its contents.
- The form labels should be left aligned similar to the settings page.
- The modal is too wide. It should have a similar column configurations as the rest of the modals.
- The cards section should be after the activity graph.
- The forms should have client and api validation (github link fails after the closure of the modal)
- We could explore other forms or notifying the user of a faulty submission: alert on the forum, etc.  Thanks Ahmad, I completely missed this mock.  Hey @ahmaxed,
I have implemented these suggestions:

1. The button should preferably be the icon itself.
2. The icon could be changed to 'faPen'.
3. The icon button should be as tall as its contents.
4. The form labels should be left aligned similar to the settings page.
5. The modal is too wide. It should have a similar column configurations as the rest of the modals.
6. The cards section should be after the activity graph.

 Thanks for the heard work here. Here are some feedback on the current state of the pr:
- I still get the double flash components on the latest commit
- Wondering if we should leave a note in the settings page since we are moving a large chunk to the profile page.
- Portfolio section in the modal needs a spacer similar to other sections
- Since the if (!process.env.CI) block is repeated multiple, feel free to make a function and reuse it.




 > I still get the double flash components on the latest commit

Here is what Sem explained to me:

> When the ""View Custom 404"" button is clicked Gatsby will show a ""PREVIEW"" of the Custom 404 page. Meaning Gatsby will show a page within a page. Resulting in the flash message showing twice.

Also, I can reproduce the double flash issue by going to the profile page and switching theme (via the toggle in the dropdown menu). So this seems to be a Gatsby thing, and the changes in this PR just happen to surface that behavior a bit more. Stamp it! @huyenltnguyen  Oh, I forgot.

Sem, if you need to add a note on the settings page (as Ahmad suggested in https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56135#issuecomment-2385648671), you can use this new Callout component: https://opensource.freecodecamp.org/ui/?path=/story/components-callout--info.

It's an alternative to `Alert` / `Flash`. Alert/Flash aren't very friendly to non-sighted users in this context, as they would immediately blast the note content to the users as soon as they are rendered (which could unnecessarily overwhelm the users).I tested the changes locally, and found a couple issues:
- When the username is changed and saved successfully, the dialog isn't closed (the success flash is behind the dialog)
- Similarly, when a portfolio item is added or removed successfully, the dialog isn't closed
- When I add or remove a social media link
  - I got redirected to the Gatsby.js development 404 page, with these errors in the console:
    - <img width=""798"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-09-24 at 02 08 56"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1f5ab91-f893-4dfb-8fc2-2062b6c65890"">
  - The page apparently could even crash (I can't reproduce this issue consistently)

Unrelated to the PR changes, but I'm not sure if I prefer having the fields in a modal. 

One issue with it is the modal would sit on top of the flash, preventing campers from reading it. We can close the modal when the Save button is clicked, but then the user would need to reopen the modal if they haven't finished updated their profile. I guess we could fix this by keeping the modal open and changing the z-index so that flash would be on top.

Another issue is modals can be closed when the user presses Escape or clicks outside, and the user would lose the changes if they accidentally close the modal. We could prevent that by perhaps showing another modal on top, asking the users if they want to discard the changes. But I think that's more work for us and probably not a good UX.

An alternative I can think of is conditionally rendering the profile info and profile inputs using modes:

```tsx
const [isViewMode, setIsViewMode] = useState(true)

return (
  isViewMode ? (
    <>
      <ViewProfile />
      <EditProfileButton onClick={() => setViewMode(false)} />
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <EditProfile />
	  <ViewProfileButton onClick={() => setViewMode(true)} />
    </>
  )
)
``` I'm not sure if we still need to iterate more on this PR or we'll have further iterations in the follow-up PRs, so I'm not clicking the Approve button yet (but ping me if you need my stamp).

---

I don't think you enjoy modifying tests, so I went ahead and updated a couple things üòÑ You can see the changes in my commits, but here is the summary:
- Added `aria-label` to the icon button (the button needs to have a label text in order to be accessible)
- Improved the test setup of `internet-presence-settings.spec.ts` (this isn't your code, but I came across it as I was reviewing the tests)
  - Previously, the test body includes additional simulation to reset the input values to the original state. This makes the test more complicated and polluted since resetting test data isn't its responsibility (not to mention the test would take longer to run).
  - I removed the irrelevant code and run `seed` in the `beforeEach` block instead
- Swapped `getByTestId()` with better queries","I tested the changes locally, and found a couple issues:

","I didn't get any errors in the previous PR (it guess the PR only changed client so it was spared?).

But changes to `api` seem to trigger `lint:ts`, which resulted some TS errors:

<img width=""726"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 16 41 03"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a953068-a44b-464a-935e-6d4c1c70205b"">

I'm not sure if there is a better fix than `@ts-ignore`.

(Also, ESLint didn't give me any errors so I was quite confused/surprised when the CI failed.) ```suggestion
    // We know that i and j are within the bounds of the array, TS doesn't
    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion
```
The error shows up because the api's config is stricter than the shared folder's config. I'm not sure how to fix this, since VSCode (correctly) uses the nearest config (shared).

Anyway, I think this clarifies the error without needing to resort to `@ts-ignore` ```ts
    [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j]!, arr[i]!];
```
Is enough to mollify TS, but it upsets eslint :face_exhaling: so we still need to disable that.  ```suggestion
    [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j]!, arr[i]!];
```"

","why did you create these (`expectedDateOnly` and `currentDateOnly`) but did not use them? how is this testing that the parameter is a date object? this test is missing `assert`

````suggestion
```js
let testDate = new Date('2024-09-27T16:16:11+05:00');
let result = formatDateLong(testDate);
assert.equal(result, 'Formatted Date (Month Day, Year): September 27, 2024'); 

// prevent hardcoding
testDate = new Date('2024-09-28T16:16:11+05:00');
result = formatDateLong(testDate);
assert.equal(result, 'Formatted Date (Month Day, Year): September 28, 2024'); 
```
```` ```suggestion
assert.equal(currentDateOnly.toString(), expectedDateOnly.toString());
```
I guess this was the idea. this is not testing that the parameter is a date object. To test if it has one parameter you can check `formatDateMMDDYYY.length` (I learned recently that the lenght is equal to the number of parameters)

````suggestion
The function`formatDateMMDDYYYY` should take one parameter.

```js
assert.lengthOf(formatDateMMDDYYYY, 1);
```
```` ```suggestion
assert.lengthOf(formatDateLong, 1);
``` It is not checking specifically for the date object, I have updated the hint text. Yes, exactly this is what was required. ```suggestion
The function`formatDateMMDDYYYY` should take a single parameter.
``` ```suggestion
  ""challengeOrder"": [{ ""id"": ""66f686b8ebdb982fa8e14330"", ""title"": ""Build a Date Conversion Program"" }],

I have modified the stories a bit where we were testing the same properties more than once.

Original prototype: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/467
<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","This test is failing for me. It looks like it's checking the `color` and not `background-color` - which is what is asked for.

Not sure why the solution isn't failing the CI tests, since that changes the background color. ```suggestion
Your labels should have a margin and font color.
``` ```suggestion
The `form-container` `div` should have a `border-radius`.
```

Not sure on this one. It doesn't say anywhere to add a border. Maybe you meant that it should have a ""visible border"" in that, it should have a `background-color`, which makes it appear to have a border. We don't have to go with my suggestion.  I used a `input, textarea` selector in my CSS, which will not pass the tests for these. I think we should make a slight adjustment - maybe either mention that ""You should have an `input` selector..."" and ""...`textarea` selector..."" or adjust the tests to allow for more flexibility. You could check the computed values and not the stylesheet code. updated this one. I added an outline as well, but that doesn't match the demo. So I have removed it. Added flexibility. maybe `Design a Contact Form` will be better here.

if we decide on the name change, then it should be updated in all places You shouldn't change this.

Changing the name to design was only for the title. the dashed name should stay the same as the others like this
` dashedName: lab-contact-form` I have used the dashed name as `design-a-business-card` in the [business card lab](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/curriculum/challenges/english/25-front-end-development/lab-business-card/6690e10ebe2181212abc9652.md) as well.

The other projects are using `build-a-x` convention in the challenge file instead of `lab-x`

So should keep `design-a-contact-form` as it is or update the the business lab project as well along with contact form lab to `lab-x`? oh I see, then we can leave it as is looks like the xxx should be removed here this also needs to be changed from `assert` to a specific method same here. I think this could work
```suggestion
assert.isTrue(el?.required);
``` ```suggestion
assert.exists(el);
``` or also just remove this line, this test is implicit in the `el?` in the next line ```suggestion
assert.isTrue(found);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isTrue(found);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isTrue(found);
``` but, can't you check that `document.querySelector('label[for=""${messageInput}""]')` exists? ```suggestion
    assert.isNotEmpty(labelText);
```

maybe this is more semantic? ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.form-container')?.backgroundColor);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.form-container')?.borderRadius);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.form-container')?.padding);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.form-container')?.width);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('label')?.margin);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('label')?.color);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(width);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotEmpty(marginBottom);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isOk(
  padding ||
  (paddingTop && paddingBottom && paddingLeft && paddingRight)
);
```

for this one, I have no idea for a more specific method. `isOk` checks that the value is truthy, so it seems the more appropriate"

It's a little tricky because not all the labs have a demo app. The JS algorithm style labs don't, for example. So the button doesn't get displayed there - and some of the labs are pretty much exact copies of the example, while some have a lot of room for creativity. So the text I ended up with was ""Build an app that is functionally similar to `<button>`this example project`</button>`. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.""

","Instead of a span, I would have made this a `button` with whatever styling is needed to make it look like the `a` element we want. I suppose with `role` of button, this does not make much of a difference. I debated between the two and used button initially, but decided to go with span. There was a reason, but I don't recall off hand. I think there was some styling that I couldn't override to make it look like the other links."

Updated user stories:

```md
# --description--

In this lab, you'll build a program to assist in managing lunch options. You'll work with an array of lunches, add and remove items from the array, and randomly select a lunch option. 

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should create a `lunches` variable and assign it some string values of different lunch items.
2. You should create a function `addLunchToEnd` that adds a new lunch item to the end of the `lunches` array.
3. You should create a function `addLunchToStart` that adds a new lunch item to the start of the `lunches` array.
4. You should create a function `removeLastLunch` that removes the last lunch item from the `lunches` array using the appropriate array method.
5. You should create a function `removeFirstLunch` that removes the first lunch item from the `lunches` array using the appropriate array method.
6. You should create a function `getRandomLunch` that generates a random number between `0` and the length of the `lunches` array. Use that random number to select a lunch and print it to the console.
7. You should create a function `showLunchMenu` that displays the current lunches as a numbered list in the format:
    - `""1. <Lunch Item>""`
    - `""2. <Lunch Item>""` (and so on, for each lunch in the array).


``` with the new version that uses `Math.random` inside a function you can test with the new helper that makes `Math.random` gives a series of numbers (removes the randomness) https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/curriculum-helpers/pull/233.

If the return statement has already been introduced at this point I would suggest having functions that return things instead of having them only print to the console @zairahira 

The updated project looks good.
I do agree with ilenia though, that we should return values instead of logging them to the console I have updated the project with new stories and hints.

I need a suggestion, should i include a test for checking the range of random numbers?
Something like this:

```
The `getRandomLunch` function should select an array item between 0 and the length of the `lunches` array.
```

There is a test to check the results of `getRandomLunch`, would another test be needed? > There is a test to check the results of getRandomLunch, would another test be needed?

I personally vote we can leave it as is for now.
We will need to do more dedicated testing for all labs and workshops in the beta phase anyway and we will be able to see if more tests are needed.  @moT01, the nested lists look better readability wise. If you have the markdown, can you share it with me? You can also commit directly if you like. Here's the markdown that produces the image @zairahira:

<details><summary>code</summary>

```
1. You should create a `lunches` variable and assign it an empty array that will be used to store lunch items.

2. You should create a function `addLunchToEnd` that takes a string parameter and adds it to the end of the `lunches` array and returns a string in the format: `""[Lunch Item] added to the end of the lunch menu.""`

3. You should create a function `addLunchToStart` that takes a string parameter and adds it to the start of the `lunches` array and returns a string in the format: `""[Lunch Item] added to the start of the lunch menu.""`

4. You should create a function `removeLastLunch` that removes the last lunch item from the `lunches` array and:
   - If successful, returns a string in the format: `""[Lunch Item] removed from the lunch menu (last).""`
   - If the `lunches` array is empty, returns a string: `""No lunches to remove.""`

5. You should create a function `removeFirstLunch` that removes the first lunch item from the `lunches` array and:
   - If successful, returns a string in the format: `""[Lunch Item] removed from the lunch menu (first).""`
   - If the `lunches` array is empty, returns a string: `""No lunches to remove.""`

6. You should create a function `getRandomLunch` that selects a random lunch item from the `lunches` array and:
   - If successful, returns a string in the format: `""Randomly selected lunch: [Lunch Item]""`
   - If the `lunches` array is empty, returns a string: `""No lunches available.""`

7. You should create a function `showLunchMenu` that:
   - If there are items in the `lunches` array, returns a string in the format: `""Menu items: [Lunch Item], [Lunch Item]...`
   - If the `lunches` array is empty, returns a string: `""The menu is empty.""`

</details> The user stories have been updated and the changes have been reflected in hints, tests and solution.Left some comments so the campers have to think more about the appropriate methods to use instead of telling them right off üëç  I don't like the idea of using regex too much, but in this case I think we have to. I left a few comments to take spacing into account.  I feel like we are spending a lot of time trying to get the regex tests to work.

But have you considered rewriting this to use functions instead? 
that way, you can test the final outcomes and test the functions again many arrays instead of just one

I just feel like we should look at other options that will make testing this easier instead of just sticking to this one version of the prototype. 

Also, I don't know if we need a user story to specifically test for the console statements. maybe just having them focus on the core functionality is enough. 



 This looks good @zairahira üëç

I left a few comments to take spacing into account.  I feel like we are spending a lot of time trying to get the regex tests to work.

But have you considered rewriting this to use functions instead? 
that way, you can test the final outcomes and test the functions again many arrays instead of just one

I just feel like we should look at other options that will make testing this easier instead of just sticking to this one version of the prototype. 

Also, I don't know if we need a user story to specifically test for the console statements. maybe just having them focus on the core functionality is enough.

I have modified the original prototype a bit as it was challenging to test constantly updating arrays.

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","```suggestion
          ""In this lab, you will review working with arrays and random numbers by building a lunch picker program.""
``` I think this description gives away to much. We should have campers think a little about what methods they will need to use.

```suggestion
In this lab, you'll build a program to assist in choosing lunch options. You'll work with two arrays: one for children's food choices and one for adults. You'll add and remove items from these arrays and then randomly select a meal from each. Finally, you'll log the results to the console.
``` we shouldn't mention how they should go about it. it is best to have campers think a little about what method or approach should work here.

```suggestion
1. You should create a `kidsMeal` variable and assign it an array with at least three strings in it.
```

 ```suggestion
2. You should create an `adultsMeal` variable and assign it an array with at least three strings in it.
``` ```suggestion
3. Once items have been added to the `kidsMeal`, you should use the appropriate array method to remove the last item.
``` ```suggestion
4. Once items have been added to the `adultsMeal`, you should use the appropriate array method to remove the first item. 
``` ```suggestion
5.  You should use the appropriate `Math` methods to generate a random number between `0` to the length of the `kidsMeal` array. Assign that result to a variable called `randomIndexKids`.
``` ```suggestion
6. You should use the appropriate `Math` methods to generate a random number between `0` to the length of the `kidsMeal` array. Assign that result to a variable called `randomIndexAdults`.
``` ```suggestion
assert.isAtLeast(kidsMeal.length, 3);
``` ```suggestion
assert.isAtLeast(adultsMeal.length, 3);
``` ```suggestion
Your `adultsMeal` array should contain only string values.
``` I have kept this intentionally as this would be the length after using `pop()` and `shift()` on the respective arrays with length `3`. I have kept this intentionally as this would be the length after using `pop()` and `shift()` on the respective arrays with length `3`. This should check that the array contains at least 3 elements at the moment of the assignment. Since it is modified, I'm afraid we should use regex for this test. Something similar to the following?

```suggestion
const matched = __helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/(const|let)\s+kidsMeal\s*=\s*\[(?<items>.+?)\]/)
const kidsMealArray = matched.groups.items.split("","");
assert.isAtLeast(kidsMealArray.length, 3);
``` ```suggestion
Your `kidsMeal` array should contain at least three items.
``` to avoid any issues with comments I think they should be removed any time a regex test is used Suggestion updated following your comment @ilenia-magoni  Thank you @Dario-DC for the suggestion, this works perfectly.
I have updated other tests too. Now, this test has been updated. @zairahira it looks like we still have this last suggested change  ```suggestion
Your `adultsMeal` array should contain at least three items.
``` The test is broken (referencing `adultsMeal`) but it doesn't work because the match is always a string. The following should work well.
The problem is if the items are variables. For that we need a different solution.
```suggestion
const matched = __helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/(const|let)\s+kidsMeal\s*=\s*\[(?<items>.+?)\]/)
const kidsMealArray = matched.groups.items.split("","");
assert.isAtLeast(kidsMealArray.length, 1);

for (let i = 0; i < kidsMealArray.length; i++) {
  const itemMatch = kidsMealArray[i].trim().match(/^(?<quote>'|""|`)(?<meal>.+)\1$/);
  assert.isNotNull(itemMatch);
  assert.notInclude(itemMatch.groups.meal, itemMatch.groups.quote)
}
``` This test doesn't work properly. If I have `const randomIndexKids = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)`, and when the test runs `randomIndexKids` is `1`, the  test does not fail. If you run it again it could be `9` and fail.

Also, it matches `Math.random()` without any relation with the assignment to `randomIndexKids`.

The same is true for the test after this one. ```suggestion

for (let i = 0; i < adultsMealArray.length; i++) {
  const itemMatch = adultsMealArray[i].trim().match(/^(?<quote>'|""|`)(?<meal>.+)\1$/);
  assert.isNotNull(itemMatch);
  assert.notInclude(itemMatch.groups.meal, itemMatch.groups.quote)
}
``` `adultsMeal` was accidentally referenced while I copied the previous test, thanks for catching that.

Now the test is failing when items are of different types üëçÔ∏è I have updated both, let me know what you think @Dario-DC. Personally I would go with this:
```suggestion
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /(const|let)\s+randomIndexKids\s*=\s*Math\s*\.\s*floor\s*\(\s*Math\s*\.\s*random\s*\(\s*\)\s*\*\s*kidsMeal\s*\.\s*length\s*\)\s*?;?/);
```
Although the use of spaces shouldn't be encouraged in several positions, it is valid. So I think we should consider it valid. ```suggestion
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /(const|let)\s+randomIndexAdults\s*=\s*Math\s*\.\s*floor\s*\(\s*Math\s*\.\s*random\s*\(\s*\)\s*\*\s*adultsMeal\s*\.\s*length\s*\)\s*?;?/);
``` ```suggestion
const condition1 = /console\s*\.\s*log\s*\(\s*(""|'|`)Today kids should eat:\1\s*,\s*kidsMeal\s*\[\s*randomIndexKids\s*\]\s*\)\s*?;?/.test(__helpers.removeJSComments(code));
``` ```suggestion
const condition2 = /console\s*\.\s*log\s*\(\s*`Today kids should eat: \$\{\s*kidsMeal\s*\[\s*randomIndexKids\s*\]\s*}`\s*\)\s*?;?/.test(__helpers.removeJSComments(code));
```"

This PR:
- Converts `quiz/show.tsx` to functional component in order to use the `useQuiz` hook from `@freecodecamp/ui`
- Updates the Quiz component integration to make it functional (this includes upgrading `@freecodecamp/ui` to v2)

Notes: 
- I'll create a follow-up PR to add some playwright tests to lock in the page behavior (I want to wait for this one to be reviewed and tested first, in case we want to change how certain things display or behave)
- This PR doesn't cover all user flows, and we will need to have a couple more rounds of iteration. See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/fCC10/issues/2#issuecomment-2376359497.

","`p` margin in global.css:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/c39208360c78a426102493a4c2007fb95cd859c5/client/src/components/layouts/global.css#L172-L177

This change is similar to:

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/ui/pull/333#discussion_r1773034258

---

This `show.tsx` component is still using the PrismFormatted component of /learn. I'll raise a separate PR for the PrismFormatted migration and will see if I can clean up this CSS rule. We don't show the help modal here, so I guess `helpCategory` isn't needed.

But `updateChallengeMeta` takes an `ChallengeMeta` object, which lists `helpCategory` as a required property.

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/c39208360c78a426102493a4c2007fb95cd859c5/client/src/redux/prop-types.ts#L399 When campers click the Check button, the completion modal will show up if they have all questions correct. Campers have a choice to either move on to the next challenge or dismiss the modal and stay on the quiz.

If they decide to close the modal and stay on the page (maybe to review their answers), both the button text and functionality need to be changed:
- The button should say ""Submit and go"" rather than ""Check your answers"" because quiz is disabled immediately when campers first click the submit button, hence there isn't anything to check.
- The button shouldn't call the `handleAnswersCheck` function again, but rather, just trigger the completion modal on click.
 Tip for reviewers: You can add a `selectedAnswer` property to the object to save some clicks.

```ts
// Pre-select an answer
return {
  // ...
  selectedAnswer: 1
}

// Pre-select the correct answer
return {
  // ...
  selectedAnswer: answer.value
}
``` I'm tracking this TODO item in https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/fCC10/issues/2#issuecomment-2376359497. This challenge type doesn't have any tests, but the submitter would fail if `tests` is null. Can we share this with the api? exam.ts uses a similar version, but shuffles in-place.

How about generify this and putting it into the shared utils?
  ```suggestion
  const [quizId] = useState(Math.floor(Math.random() * quizzes.length));
  const quiz = quizzes[quizId].questions;
```
State is stable between renders, so we can just pass it a random thing and will never change. We can't shuffle here, since it shuffles each render. It makes the UX a bit trippy.

Instead, we can use the same trick as for random: wrap the whole thing in `useState` so it's randomized, but only once. ```suggestion
    const unansweredQuestions = quizData.reduce<number[]>(
      (acc, curr, id) => (curr.selectedAnswer == null ? [...acc, id + 1] : acc),
```
Style nit. Slightly cleaner, imo :man_shrugging:  ```suggestion
      []
```
Another nit. No need for an assertion if you provide the type to reduce. I wonder if we'll want a help wanted link/button at some point. We can decide later, though. That's a bit odd. Quizzes are essentially the same as a video challenge and they don't have any problems.

I'll take a look. `useEffect` feels like the wrong tool for this. We're using it to handle a click event, but in a roundabout way.

As I understand what's happening this is the sequence

1. User fills in the quiz (maybe partially)
2. If partially complete, we ask them to finish
3. If complete we validate
4. If it fails we update the state returned by `useQuiz` and do some logic in the show component i.e. call a function (let's call it `onSuccess`)
5. If it succeeds we again update the `useQuiz` state and do some different logic (`onFailure`, say) in the show component

Everything is fine, except 4. and 5. Reason being, we shouldn't have to look at the state to know to call `onSuccess`  i.e. checking `hasSubmitted`'s value and comparing `correctAnswerCount` to `quiz.length`. `onSuccess` should be called immediately in response to the click, rather than indirectly when the state changes.

If that makes sense, I think we can implement it by passing `onSuccess` and  `onFailure` into `useQuiz`, so that it can call them when `validateAnswers` is called.

What do you reckon?

 Thanks for calling this out.

This is the part that I'm not happy with as the on click logic should be contained / handled by a single function (we provide the `validateAnswers` function for exactly this purpose). This was a quick hack to get the page working. I'll update the `useQuiz` hook with your suggestions üëç   I ended up computing the correct answer count here, rather than using the `correctAnswerCount` value from `useQuiz`.

The issue with `correctAnswerCount` is, its value is only updated when `validateAnswers` is called. However, `correctAnswerCount` is actually a state, so the update doesn't happen immediately, and thus we can't use it to construct the error message (the correct count would be 0).

We would either need to call `setErrorMessage` in a `useEffect` in order to catch the state update, or we can just compute the correct count ourselves. There's another way: `errorMessage` doesn't have to be state, since its value can be derived from `hasSubmitted`, `quizData`, `correctAnswerCount` and `quiz`. i.e. state and props that already exist.

That means `errorMessage` is ""redundant state"" which is something of anti-pattern.

Since changing this touches a bunch of things, I'll just push a commit so you can see what I'm talking about. Ah, I see they do the same :cold_sweat:  I'll address this separately. For now, this is 100% the correct approach."

It looks like this is just a partial copy of an existing challenge? I don't see the id of this challenge in any existing challenges - or a challenge that is the exact same. I do see [this one, which is similar](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/create-a-hash-table) - so yea, I think we're fine to just create a new id here.

Only problem I noticed was the remove user stories/tests. I originally had this as my remove method:

```
  remove(key) {
    const hashedKey = this.hash(key);
    delete this.collection[hashedKey][key];
  }
```

So when it ran, I was left with an empty object if that was the only k/v in that hashed key - tests 12 and 13 are checking that the collection `isEmpty` - it wasn't, so they failed. We could change that user story to something like: ""The `remove` method should take a key as a parameter and remove the corresponding key-value pair from the hash table. If that's the last key-value pair, it should remove the hash key as well."" Not sure how to best word it. The tests could maybe be reworded and/or changed slightly as well.

Instead of the pure regex test.

This will also allow using two different types of quotes for the two attribute values, unlike the current regex because of the capture group (the quotes used for the two attribute values must match).

This was motivated by this thread.

It is cleaner as well, in my opinion.

As a side benefit, this fixes a bug (introduced in https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/55874) where the number of the test was

Sure, the files have been reverted + ignored. You're more than welcome, thanks for merging.

Now that it's in a clean state, you could run `pnpm run knip:all` every once in a while to keep tabs on the state of unused files, exports and dependencies. Or even add it to CI once you're confident it's stable enough.

Best of luck! (FYI, it's added to knip's integration suite. Not much to see here but it's a great repo to keep exercising: https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip/actions/runs/11054492711/job/30711431413) Oh, cool. So, the idea is that you want to know if knip starts throwing unexpectedly? Indeed. But also I'd like to know if it starts to report false positives. I wouldn't know without actually go in and review the Action job's output, but the goal is to remove `--no-exit-code`. Tricky. Maybe the solution is just for us to try using it in our CI. Then we can just @ you if we don't understand what's going on. How does that sound?

I'd like to give it another go, so I'll add it now and we can see how it works in practice.

EDIT: I spoke too soon, it looks like there's still a lot to remove :( > Tricky. Maybe the solution is just for us to try using it in our CI. Then we can just @ you if we don't understand what's going on. How does that sound?

Absolutely, just don't want to cause any extra work on your end. But if you decide to do so, both projects can benefit.

What's the command you're using? A `pnpm run knip:all` in main currently gives no issues reported by Knip here. But maybe you have a different repo state than mine with regards to what exactly's being built, etc? Here are the steps I've used: https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip/blob/2b550b0f8e384f903cc8bb7d0e7541d04df0547a/.github/workflows/integration.yml#L126-L130 After following those steps I got this:

It's definitely possible my repo is an a weird state, but it's behaving itself otherwise. Dang, that's odd. If you're willing to do a `git clean -fdx` we could compare:

Also, I now see that I've accidentally added https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/9c6ab8de9b36df8bb72e01ed466973d45b37d62b/package.json#L132

Sorry about that. Could this be the issue? Doesn't seem to be, no. I removed it (and git cleaned), but nothing much changed. I'm a bit mystified, to be honest.

It works fine in Gitpod, so _something_ is wrong with my local setup. I'll let you know if/when I figure it out!

Thanks for the PR @webpro - We definitely like `Knip`. Happy to see how far it has come. Good luck! Thanks for taking care of the migration, @webpro. Hopefully one day the repo won't be such a pain to configure, but at least we're a useful test case :cold_sweat: ","Thanks for the PR @webpro - We definitely like `Knip`. Happy to see how far it has come. Good luck! Thanks for taking care of the migration, @webpro. Hopefully one day the repo won't be such a pain to configure, but at least we're a useful test case :cold_sweat: ","When introducing Knip ~2 years ago I think we've kinda implicitly concluded Knip v1 wasn't ready for a repository like this. Too much configuration and knowledge was required for to use it in a convenient and productive way.

We've come a long way. I think now that we have Knip v5 it's useful even (or especially?!) for a large repo like freeCodeCamp. I would even say it could be useful to add to CI. But for now I've kept the current strategy of using `npx -y knip` intact to not introduce any surprises.

The biggest/most relevant changes in Knip:

- All workspaces are analyzed by default (in ~23s on my machine)
- [Support for CommonJS](https://knip.dev/guides/working-with-commonjs) has improved a lot, but still a few modification where necessary to remove ambiguity (also prepares for a potential migration to ESM).

This repo has been super useful to improve Knip itself, so I'm grateful for that and the least I could do in return is to actually remove some clutter from the freeCodeCamp repo.

I'm going to add freeCodeCamp to the integration test suite of Knip itself to prevent future regressions (less surprises for the maintainers in case Knip would be used more often).

~Before un-drafting this PR I'll make sure QA is green.~ 

**Edit 09/24**: Looking at the resulting config ([knip.jsonc](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/1cb5c864e393bf20096cca7a41c9bd0f68d5520e/knip.jsonc)), nearly all of it is to compensate for custom structures/issues that can't really be automatically accounted for by a generic project linter. That is to say, I think this is basically as good as it gets (which could still not be worth managing this configuration, that's up to you obviously, no hard feelings either way).

","There should be a check that there are actually 3 parameters.
Currently the test is passing with any number of arguments. That's not an easy thing to test, but as long as the other tests pass, the camper is using the three parameters, so I don't think it's necessary, it would be a regex, and those can become quite rigid I think it would be easier to remove "" that takes three arguments"" from this hint without having a test just for that. It is tested when the function is called passing 3 arguments in the following tests. ```suggestion

If we are to follow grammar, the comma after 'Hi' and before a person's name is what we could call a vocative comma, used to separate the phrase and the person we address. It is rarely seen in everyday texts, but it is, grammatically speaking, necessary. This link gives more details: https://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/comma_with_dear_hello_and_hi.htm
The phrase 'Hi there', however, does not carry a comma as it is a complete expression. 'There', in this case, is not a name, so no need for the vocative comma here. Thanks for noticing that!

Note: there is a mix of challenges in the description of the PR, pointing that the comma between 'Hi' and 'Tom' should be omitted. According to the grammar reference, that would not be the case. The fact it is common usage to omit it, though, might point at a different direction. The approval and merging is related to the two md files it fixes, since the expression 'hi there' does not fit the same grammar explanation. @DanielRosa74, so sorry, looking back now I realize that the title for this PR is misleading. It's really to remove the comma between ""Hi"" and ""there"". I think I'm more sleep deprived than I thought.

You're right that it's grammatically correct for a comma to fall between ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" and someone's name. I usually omit it in my writing, but that's just a personal choice. It really doesn't bother me one way or another.

Someone emailed support with some confusion about the expected answer here because the example in step 33 and the closed captions for that step and for dialogue 2 of ""Learn Greetings in Your First Day at the Office"" have a comma in the text ""Hi, there"". However, the expected answer is ""Hi there"" with no comma.

- Dialogue 2: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-greetings-in-your-first-day-at-the-office/dialogue-2-tom-meets-the-coworker-next-to-him
- Step 33: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-greetings-in-your-first-day-at-the-office/task-33

Don't consider this a massive improvement, I do think it looks better. Tested with different browser zoom and font size.

It's a lot of changes for such a simple bug, but I think it is worth the update. Even if we could fix it with fewer changes, e.g. switch to rem for the margin and lower the values.

Separate commits to keep track of what I was doing.

Ran the `sync-i18n` script, but it messed with a bunch of unrelated files. For example, it deleted Odin project files from the Chinese and Arabic files, and made other changes to unrelated files including creating files (1507 changes in total). So I reverted it back. Not sure what the correct process is or if the docs for updating step based challenges is out of date.

Other PRs for this challenge are in progress, so it will end up with merge conflicts that need to be fixed.

Changes made:

1. Use flexbox for the call stack layout.

2. Created a box for the call stack and gave it a heading.

3. Added monospace font style, personal preference, but I think it fits the subject.

4. Removed the inline margin on call stack `p` elements and the related challenge step.

This PR enhances the test cases to ensure that campers completely remove the myTaskArr array and all related localStorage items in their code. Previously, the tests would pass even if only one or two tasks were deleted. With these changes, the tests will require the camper to fully remove all instances of myTaskArr and any associated localStorage items to proceed.

Changes Made:

1. **Regex Pattern Update**: Modified the regex pattern in the assert.notMatch function to comprehensively check the absence of any references to myTaskArr and related localStorage items.
2. **Additional Assertions: Added assertions to ensure**:
   - No declaration or use of myTaskArr exists in the code.
   - No retrieval of localStorage item ""data"".
   -  No setting of localStorage item ""data"" with myTaskArr.

","Could you make each of these into separate test? And split the remaining, not covered yet, part of original regex into separate tests? sorry I did not get this! Can you please explain this comment a bit more? hey @gikf any input on the above? @gikf  BTW I have made them into separate tests.

And fixes pattern to match closing of the multi-line comment.","I don't particularly like this regex. The task is to remove the entire `if` - if they just change a tiny bit of it, it passes - e.g. change `count` to `coun`. We don't want them to have `if`, `done`, `count` or any of it. I think I would test this by checking the surrounding code - make sure they have something like this:

```
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
let result = """"
```

But maybe that's too restrictive. I'll let you change it if you want, @gikf - or like I said, it's pretty minor so I'm fine with it. That's really good point. I tried to write regex, which would allow optionally the `continueLoop = false;` from the inside `if`, but it's a bit spotty once parts of it are getting removed:
```suggestion
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /rows\.push\s*\(padRow\s*\(\s*done\s*,\s*count\s*\)\s*\)\s*;?\s*(?:continueLoop\s*=\s*false\s*;?)\s*\}\s*let\s*result/);
```

Moving test for the _whole_ `if`, after the one testing removing of the `continueLoop...`, would allow to make stricter test for the snipped from your comment: 


````
You should remove `if` statement with its contents.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /rows\.push\s*\(padRow\s*\(\s*done\s*,\s*count\s*\)\s*\)\s*;?\s*\}\s*let\s*result\s*=/);

The only reason I didn't go with adding the styles in a stylesheet is because there are already inline styles, so keeping the styles in one place is easier to manage.

> Also wondering about other clients. Maybe it will make things more difficult for mobile or other future clients, in that they may have to overwrite the inline styles.

I was wondering the same. I'm not sure if we want to have inline styles in the curriculum content at all, and was thinking how we could style the content in a different way.

I think an alternative approach is to include the desired layout/arrangement in the metadata, similar to the `dialog` in the `scene` JSON of English challenges. The clients would parse the metadata and handle the display accordingly.

Do you think this approach makes sense, and is it something we can add to CAP / CAP API? Thanks Huyen!In case you haven't done it yet, could you include this two? :slightly_smiling_face:

","Previously with Bootstrap, `img` grew to their true size by default and didn't respect the size of its container. The `img-responsive` class was needed because of this behavior.

However, this isn't the case now that we have switched to use the Tailwind preflight (via the base stylesheet of `@freecodecamp/ui`). `img` is now resized accordingly based on its container size.

Ref:
- Bootstrap `.img-responsive`: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/f17f882df292b29323f1e1da515bd16f326cee4a/dist/css/bootstrap.css#L1118-L1126
- Tailwind preflight: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/3.4/src/css/preflight.css#L376-L380 The images were centered thanks to the `center-block` class. The class is a Bootstrap class and was removed via #55068 without a replacement, causing the misalignment.

Instead of adding the `.center-block` rule to `global.css`, I'm removing the class and adding the CSS rules to the inline `style` attribute instead, so that the styles are in one place and easier to debug. This change also allows curriculum files to be independent of its client.

`.center-block` only specifies:

```css
display: block;
margin-right: auto;
margin-left: auto;
```

But I'm adding a `margin-bottom` to the image as well, so that there is a space between the image and the text below it. The margin value (`1.2rem`) is the same margin that each `p` has:

The issue is tracked in #53414. These images are centered by the outer div, so no additional CSS needed. In other words, the `center-block` class is redundant even if the class is available.

We also don't need a bottom margin here since there is already a gap created by the `br` on line 20. No additional margin needed here as the images are rendered within a `p`, which already has a bottom margin. No additional margin needed here as the images are rendered within a `p`, which already has a bottom margin. No additional margin needed here as the images are rendered within a `p`, which already has a bottom margin.

The images are also inline elements, so `center-block` is redundant / has no effect. The image is in a table cell on its own, so a bottom margin isn't needed."

Not sure if this is the actual issue, but the last test was failing with the error: 

```js
// console output
[ReferenceError: deleteBookmarkButton is not defined]
``` ```suggestion
1. Each radio button should have a corresponding label containing an anchor element with the bookmark name and the `href` attribute set to the bookmark URL.
``` I noticed that now the order is `229` in the sheet. The order should be updated to `229`. ```suggestion
1. If one or more bookmarks in local storage have the selected category you should add a radio button with `id` and `value` attributes set to the bookmark name to the `#category-list`'s inner HTML for each of those bookmarks.
```

Wasn't sure where exactly to add the radio buttons. This says where. ```suggestion
1. If none of the bookmarks in local storage have the category, you should set the inner HTML of the `#category-list` to a `p` element with the text `No Bookmarks Found`.
```

I tried to use innerHTML += stuff - because it said ""add"" - which failed the test. ```suggestion
1. When you click `#close-list-button`, you should run your function to hide the `#bookmark-list-section` and display the main section.

Originally, we weren't working with functions because the functions module was further down. But the labs team were having issues with testing and it made more sense to have function appear earlier. So we moved it.

As result, this project will work better from a testing perspective and learning perspective to use functions. 

Something along these lines:

```js
// this is just one way to solve this. Encourage campers to design the function their own way, with whatever loops they want, as long as they return the correct result

// or just have one function called getCount that takes in a strType and sentence since vowelCount, consonant and punctuationCount are all the same
function getVowelCount(sentence) {
  const vowels = ""aeiou"";
  let count = 0;

  for (const char of sentence.toLowerCase()) {
    if (vowels.includes(char)) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

// have a step to encourage campers to test out their function

const vowelCount = getVowelCount(""Apples are tasty fruits"");
console.log(`Vowel Count: ${vowelCount}`);

// this is just one way to solve this. Encourage campers to design the function their own way, with whatever loops they want, as long as they return the correct result
function getWordCount(sentence) {
  const words = sentence.trim().split(/\s+/);
  return words.length;
}

// have a step to encourage campers to test out their function

const wordCount = getWordCount(""I love freeCodeCamp"");
console.log(`Word Count: ${wordCount}`);

etc....
 
```

This will make it easier to test because we will only care about the final function outputs and test that. Also, it will better align with the camper feedback and moderator feedback we have gotten over the past several months. 

We should encourage them to design these functions using whatever loops and methods necessary. This will force campers to think more about what to do and allow for more creativity in solutions. This will also create a better learning experience. 

For example, one of the steps could be something like this:

```md
In this workshop, you will build a sentence analyzer that will take a sentence and get the count for the number of words, vowels, consonants, and punctuation marks. 

In this first step, create a `getVowelCount` function with parameter called `sentence`. Your function should return the total number of vowels in a sentence. 

For example, if the sentence is `""Apples are tasty fruits""` the function should return the number `7`.

A vowel is any of the following characters: `""aeiou""`. You will want to loop through the sentence and check if the current character is a vowel. You will need a way to keep track of the current count of vowels, and return that count.
``` Left some comments for rewords and fixing some spelling errors.
But otherwise looks good.

We might still get push back on the repetitive punctuation, vowel and consonant count functions since they are basically the same. But we will see how the community responds when this is in beta and make any adjustments from there","I went through the project and we are going to need to make some updates to the original prototype.

Originally, we weren't working with functions because the functions module was further down. But the labs team were having issues with testing and it made more sense to have function appear earlier. So we moved it.

As result, this project will work better from a testing perspective and learning perspective to use functions. 

Something along these lines:

```js
// this is just one way to solve this. Encourage campers to design the function their own way, with whatever loops they want, as long as they return the correct result

// or just have one function called getCount that takes in a strType and sentence since vowelCount, consonant and punctuationCount are all the same
function getVowelCount(sentence) {
  const vowels = ""aeiou"";
  let count = 0;

  for (const char of sentence.toLowerCase()) {
    if (vowels.includes(char)) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

// have a step to encourage campers to test out their function

const vowelCount = getVowelCount(""Apples are tasty fruits"");
console.log(`Vowel Count: ${vowelCount}`);

// this is just one way to solve this. Encourage campers to design the function their own way, with whatever loops they want, as long as they return the correct result
function getWordCount(sentence) {
  const words = sentence.trim().split(/\s+/);
  return words.length;
}

// have a step to encourage campers to test out their function

const wordCount = getWordCount(""I love freeCodeCamp"");
console.log(`Word Count: ${wordCount}`);

etc....
 
```

This will make it easier to test because we will only care about the final function outputs and test that. Also, it will better align with the camper feedback and moderator feedback we have gotten over the past several months. 

We should encourage them to design these functions using whatever loops and methods necessary. This will force campers to think more about what to do and allow for more creativity in solutions. This will also create a better learning experience. 

For example, one of the steps could be something like this:

```md
In this workshop, you will build a sentence analyzer that will take a sentence and get the count for the number of words, vowels, consonants, and punctuation marks. 

In this first step, create a `getVowelCount` function with parameter called `sentence`. Your function should return the total number of vowels in a sentence. 

For example, if the sentence is `""Apples are tasty fruits""` the function should return the number `7`.

A vowel is any of the following characters: `""aeiou""`. You will want to loop through the sentence and check if the current character is a vowel. You will need a way to keep track of the current count of vowels, and return that count.
``` Left some comments for rewords and fixing some spelling errors.
But otherwise looks good.

We might still get push back on the repetitive punctuation, vowel and consonant count functions since they are basically the same. But we will see how the community responds when this is in beta and make any adjustments from there","Checklist:

          ""In this workshop, you'll review working with JavaScript loops by building a sentence analyzer app.""
``` ```suggestion
It's time to count the consonants. Create a `getConsonantCount` function with a `sentence` parameter.
``` ```suggestion
Now it is time to test your `getVowelCount` function.

Create a `vowelCount` variable and assign it the result of calling the `getVowelCount` function with the argument of `""Apples are tasty fruits""`

After that, log the following to the console: `""Vowel Count: [vowel count goes here]""`. Replace  `[vowel count goes here]` with the the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the `+` operator here.
``` ```suggestion
Inside the function, use a loop to count the number of consonants in the `sentence` that will be passed into the function when it is called. A consonant is anything that is not the following characters: `""aeiou""`. 
``` ```suggestion
Now it is time to test your `getConsonantCount` function.

Create a `consonantCount` variable and assign it the result of calling the `getConsonantCount` function with the argument of `""Coding is fun""`

After that, log the following to the console: `""Consonant Count: [Consonant count goes here]""`. Replace  `[Consonant count goes here]` with the the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the `+` operator here.
``` we don't need this test case.
the case insensitive should only apply to the `a-z` characters ```suggestion
Now it is time to test your `getPunctuationCount` function.

Create a `punctuationCount` variable and assign it the result of calling the `getPunctuationCount` function with the argument of `""WHAT?!?!?!?!?""`

After that, log the following to the console: `""Punctuation Count: [Punctuation count goes here]""`. Replace  `[Punctuation count goes here]` with the the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the `+` operator here.
``` this hint of `""Punctuation Count: ${punctuationCount}""`  implies that we are only going to accept template literals here

You should log the following to the console: `""Punctuation Count: [Punctuation count goes here]""`. Replace  `[Punctuation count goes here]` with the the actual variable name. Make sure to use proper string concatenation syntax here.

As discussed in that PR, there's a nicer way to format the questions. This PR applies those changes.

Before:

```md
# --quizzes--

## --quiz--

### --question--

Placeholder question

### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

Placeholder distractor 2

Placeholder distractor 3

### --answer--

Placeholder answer

### --question--
```

After:

```md
# --quizzes--

## --quiz--

### --question--

#### --text--

Placeholder question

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

#### --question--
```

i.e. the properties are one heading deeper, `--question--` is now a group header and `--text--` replaces it as a property.

Another day, another ping for the mobile team. Sorry, @Nirajn2311 :cold_sweat:

There's still a bit more work to be done bringing the various challenge formats into alignment. Before we can do that, I wanted to add a nice tool to deal with repeated properties. i.e. multiple quizzes.  The quiz format goes like this:

```md
## --quiz--

### --question--

What?

### --distractors--

Is?

---

Going?

...

## --quiz--

### --question--

...

```

with an arbitrary number of quizzes. Because the properties (question, distractors etc.) are nested (### rather than ##)  `getAllSections(tree,'--quiz--')` gets us all of those quizzes.

As it stands, multiple choice questions (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/refs/heads/main/curriculum/challenges/english/08-data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-course/data-analysis-example-a.md) don't follow that format.

```md
# --questions--

## --text--

What?

## --answers--

blah

---

blah

## --text--

More?

## --answers--

blah

---

blah


```

making it messier to parse and the grouping is less obvious.

## In short

We should be more consistent in how we format the challenges. If we do, we can write cleaner, more maintainable parser code.

Rather than testing how the plugins work when given pre-constructed ASTs, this tests them against parser output. There are two reasons to prefer this:

- It is a lot easier to understand what a plugin does when you can look at the .md file, rather than the AST.
- If we change the parser, we need to know what plugins break.

Just to clarify, this is very similar to the old challenge with a couple of minor changes. But I guess we want to deal with all the converted challenges in the same way. @moT01, I went through the lab and there are only some monir changes from the original:

- Instructions are added in the user stories format.
- There are a few more hints.
- The following `print()` method isn't there in the new seed code.

```js
print() {
    console.log(this.collection);
  }

These aren't major changes, so the challengeID should be the same as existing.

 > Is this why the paragraph and code tags are showing now?

@jdwilkin4 Yep, the quiz component has some issues (an oversight on my part), and displaying question text with code is one of them. I have a follow-up PR to address that (along with other things): https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56163. I'm not sure if this would affect anything in this PR, but I was working on the submission flow of the quiz challenge (in #56163), and I got an error in the `completion-epic.js` file as the `challengeTests` array is undefined.

We can look into that once #56163 is ready for review. But I thought I should mention it in case we want to make any changes here. alright, I think this should be good to go Sorry @Sembauke @Nirajn2311, it's another PR that touches the challenge schema. I am testing this locally, and I see all of these paragraph and code tags

 Left a few questions but looks good so far üëç  LGTM :+1:  Nothing to change in mobile app","I am going to open this up for review. This adds quizzes to the challenge parser - that part is done, or ready to be reviewed anyway. It parses markdown with headings that looks like this:

```
# --quizzes--
## --quiz--
### --question--
### --distractors--
### --answer--
### --question--
### --distractors--
### --answer--
## --quiz--
### --question--
### --distractors--
### --answer--
```

You end up with a `quizzes` array, with multiple different quizzes (sets of questions). See the type in prop-types.ts or one of the other files with the type.

It also adds the first quiz challenge.

The show component on the client is really just a placeholder to display the quizzes for now. It will need some additional work to make it functional and pretty.

Update: This also adds a quiz with 20 placeholder questions to each of the boilerplate quizzes that we added.

I am leaning towards leaving it out since this is a quiz.


 maybe I missed this in the show component, but will the question options be randomized too?
because it looks like the answer will always be the first one The answer is always the first one because I made a script to get all the questions from the spreadsheet, and just put them in the order they were on there. I may have to manually go and move them around. I like knownledge üòÑ  ```suggestion
        throw Error('the --quizzes-- section should contain at least one quiz');
``` There are a few comments and a console log here. Are they placeholders for future code? We can't make this required as it stands, since the boilerplate quiz md files don't have `--quizzes--` sections.

The quiz component does rely on them, though, so it throws when trying to render. Maybe the solution is to add placeholder questions to all the boilerplates. It's a trivial search and replace job, so I think that's the way to go. What do you reckon? Randomize in a followup? This whole component was mostly a copy/paste from an existing one. It will need to be fully gone over to make it work right and clean it up. So I would be fine with any minor things like this getting in. Yea, this was just a quick and dirty to allow it to render. See other comment about this component. ‚úÖ  The new structure changes this so the order doesn't matter. There's just ""distractors"" and ""answer"" - no numerical answer.

const inputs = document.querySelectorAll('ul li span.favorite-icon');
assert(inputs.length)
```
When `inputs` is empty the for..of loop does not run. Therefore the test does not fail. ```suggestion
In this lab you will use JavaScript click events to toggle the appearance of a favorite icon. When the heart icon is clicked, the appearance of the heart changes from empty to filled, and vice versa.
``` ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
5. When a `span` element containing a heart is clicked, the class `filled` should be added to the clicked span if it doesn't already have it, and removed if it does already have it.
6. When a `span` element containing a heart is clicked, the heart should change from `&#9825;` to `&#10084;` if it has the first heart, or the other way around if it has the second.
```

I tried to reword these to make it a little easier to understand - ended up splitting it into two user stories. Still doesn't feel quite right, but I think it's a little better. ```suggestion
3. The three list items should contain the item name followed by a `span` element with the class `favorite-icon` and an id of `favoriteIcon1`, `favoriteIcon2`, and `favoriteIcon3`, respectively.
```

I would vote to switch it back to kebab-case - but camel-case is valid. Also, I don't actually see the id's being used in the tests or in the solution. Should we just remove the id's? I think I would do that. @moT01 How about this:

5. When a `span` element containing a heart is clicked, you should add the `filled` class to the clicked `span` if it's not already present, and remove it if it is.

6. When a `span` element containing a heart is clicked, the heart symbol should toggle between `&#9825;` (empty heart) and `&#10084;` (filled heart), depending on its current state. I would agree, those IDs aren't being used anywhere.
I have removed them from the instruction and the tests. Yea, that would work better I think. @moT01 
I have updated these 2 stories.

Also, the `filled` class is just being used in script logic to identify whether the icon is filled or not. It's not adding a colour or any other style. The icon `&#10084` is already a filled black heart. So, it shouldn't need a separate user story. ```suggestion

1. You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id=""main-doc""`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
1. Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five.
1. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
1. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header ""JavaScript and Java"" should have a corresponding `id=""JavaScript_and_Java""`).
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each).
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each).
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each).
1. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id=""navbar""`.
1. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
1. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.
1. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar.
1. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a ""Hello world"" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text ""Hello world"").
1. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text ""Hello world"", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header).
1. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id=""navbar""` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
1. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query.

Without these changes it's possible for the tests to randomly fail, but with this seed, we know it won't fail in CI.

It's still possible to fail the tests in practice by calling Math.random in a certain pattern, but it's unlikely and we can improve the tests if that does actually happen.

because this is more universal cs topics instead of js specific same here.
we could drop javascript and just leave it to dynamic programming I was going to do that, but looking at the sheet - I believe it was more than that - for instance, basic operations, and order of operations, etc. (not Math object) - but it does also include some of the Math object. So I just went with `Math`. What do you think? I dunno, these all could certainly be better - I just made a generic small description. But I think I would stick to describing it as a quiz - that's what it is. We have the review page for the reviews. It's pretty minor - we may want to revisit all these descriptions to come up with something better. I think anything is good enough for now. ‚úÖ Fixed, will be added with next commit. ‚úÖ Will be added with next commit. ‚úÖ Will be added with next commit. ‚úÖ Added in next commit. ‚úÖ added with next commit.

      ""lab-javascript-trivia-bot"": {
        ""title"": ""Build a JavaScript Trivia Bot"",
``` ```suggestion
        ""intro"": [""In this lab, you will practice working with JavaScript variables and strings by building a trivia bot.""]
``` I think anytime we ask them to create variables we should allow them to create variables how they want using `const`, `let` or even `var` if they really want to. 
Because we only should care at this point, if they know how to declare a variable and assign a value to it.

The only time we should be specific is if the value needs to be reassigned. then we should have them use `let`. otherwise, we shouldn't care.  this should be broken up into 3 separate tests. it is more granular that way and will help campers better see where they went wrong instead of just having one test.

one test to check for `botName`

one test to check for `botLocation `

one test to check for `favoriteLanguage `

and we shouldn't care if they use const here because let and var are valid too I don't think ""JavaScript"" is the best, as the language to talk about is not mandated These are the user stories as they were written and approved, I will make the change ```suggestion
You should declare a `botName` variable and give it a value.
``` ```suggestion
You should declare a `botLocation` variable and give it a value.
``` ```suggestion
You should declare a `favoriteLanguage` variable and give it a value.
``` ```suggestion
You should use `let` to declare a new variable `codingFact`.
``` ```suggestion
You should give `codingFact` a value  that includes `favoriteLanguage` using concatenation.
``` I would suggest ""Trivia Bot"", removing ""JavaScript"". Or ""Programming Trivia Bot""?"

","we will need an intro here.
you can probably borrow from what is already in the JS beta portion and modify to suit the needs of this lab I think this should be ""Build a Set of Football Team Cards"" instead of ""Build Football Team Cards"" this comment can be removed this should be updated in all areas yeah, I think that should be fine to give them the freedom to have additional keys if they want. 
so, as long as they have the 4 keys we are looking for them it is fine if they want to add more 
```suggestion
1. The `isCaptain` property should have value of a boolean. One of the players should have their `isCaptain` property set to `true`.
``` ```suggestion
1. You should create a `footballTeam` object with the following properties: `team`, `year`, `headCoach`, `players`.
``` ```suggestion
In this lab, you will build a set of football team cards. The user should be able to use the dropdown menu and filter between the different players based on their positions.
``` I would be more specific here

```suggestion
1. You should display the `coach`, `team` and `year` values on the page. These values should be displayed in the HTML elements with the `id` values of `head-coach`, `team` and `year`. 
``` ```suggestion
1. When the dropdown menu is used to select one of the positions, only players of that position should be shown. If the `""All Players""` option is selected, then all of the players should display on the page.
``` should I also update the dashed name? from `lab-football-team-cards` to `lab-set-of-football-team-cards`? I think the dashed name is fine to leave as is ```suggestion
You should display the `coach`, `team` and `year` values from the `footballTeam` object in the HTML elements with the `id` values of `head-coach`, `team` and `year`. 
``` ```suggestion
1. You should display the players data on the page inside the `#player-cards` element, each player should be displayed in a `div` with class of `player-card`, and nested in it, an `h2` containing the name of the player, and `(Captain)` in case of the player being captain, and a `p` containing `Position:` and the position of the player.
``` ```suggestion
When the option `Position Forward` is selected, only forward players should be shown within `#player-cards`.
``` ```suggestion
When the option `Position Midfielder` is selected, only midfielder players should be shown within `#player-cards`.
``` ```suggestion
When the option `Position Defender` is selected, only defender players should be shown within `#player-cards`.
``` ```suggestion
When the option `Position Goalkeeper` is selected, only goalkeeper players should be shown.
``` ```suggestion
When the option `All players` is selected, all players should be shown within `#player-cards`.
``` ```suggestion

Does this replace https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/55884 or are you deciding between them? It replaces it. The main difference being the way you create the questions in the markdown. The other one was to add another heading for each question, e.g: `--question1--`, `--question2--`, etc, along with the subheadings for each question. With this, you just need to add more sub-headings e.g: `--text--`, `-answers--`, `--video-solution--` This should be good to go. The mobile team added the ability to handle the new questions. I believe we will need to do a curriculum sync after this gets merged. @moT01 

Things look good.
Once the failing node tests for italian and portuguese are resolved then we should be good to merge this in That's going to need a curriculum sync after this gets merged.LGTM :+1:",LGTM :+1:,"Second attempt at this. 

It's a start to allowing many multiple choice questions on a single challenge. It adjusts the challenge parser to allow more questions by just adding additional `--text--`, `--answers--`, and `--video-solution--` headers - and puts all the questions in an array.

For now, the client just gets the first in the array and uses the rest of the existing code. I will make another PR to map over them and display them all.

To test: you can find any multiple choice challenge, add an additional questions by copy/pasting the question that's there - just the `text`, `answers` and `video-solution` part. To end up with something like this:

```
# --questions--

## --text--

When making a request from the Twitter API, what information must always be sent with the request?

## --answers--

Twitter username

---

date range

---

search term

---

key

## --video-solution--

4

## --text--

Then find the challenge in graphiql and check the questions.

One extra change I made was to move all the `--assignment--` headers that were nested in a question to outside of the question. Those were all in the Odin section.

At the moment we don't, but that's obviously not ideal.Discussed a bit: We will keep moving forwards with this API, but might head a different direction with the types in the future, as it might not make sense to have the client (main thread) determine the return type.","Discussed a bit: We will keep moving forwards with this API, but might head a different direction with the types in the future, as it might not make sense to have the client (main thread) determine the return type.","The normal pattern for worker communication is via onMessage listeners. This makes for awkward code when all you really want is to be able to write code like this:
`const res = await fetch(...)`

This module creates a similar api, by abstracting over the message passing, so that the client can simply await the Promise'd response.

This will be used in the TypeScript lessons, since they want to send messages to a TS worker and get back compiled code.

Thanks to @sashee for the [excellent blog post](https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-use-async-await-with-postmessage/) pointing out how to use MessageChannel to achieve this. Any mistakes are my own!

Could you port this fix in that repo instead? Alright, I'll take a look at it! I am not entirely sure if it has something to do with the Prism Component itself or with the details element applying it's max width to the child elements. Causing the Prism component to inline instead of using it's content width.

cc: @ojeytonwilliams  I haven't looked into that deeply, but all of this going to be handled by the ui-components, so I assume this fix will need to be there too. @huyenltnguyen probably know if the detail element will be part of the component :)I can't reproduce the issue so I can't test the fix. Though I randomly checked some challenges and the challenge description seems to be displaying correctly still.

I can also confirm that the issue isn't in PrismFormatted as I can't reproduce it in fcc/ui (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/ui/pull/319). I guess we could keep the changes here in /learn, then revisit when we get to a code example/code snippet component (I reckon we'd probably need to build one in fcc/ui in order to share it between /learn and CAP). It looks like the bug was introduced here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/55681, so it should be enough to provide a more specific selector to fix it:","I can't reproduce the issue so I can't test the fix.

      await expect(donationModal).toBeVisible();
```
Isn't this all we need here?

Also, why is the modal being shown on each submission? The name `changeDonationLogic` implies that this is an action, but it's used as a state. Also it's quite vague (change to what?).

How about `isRandomCompletionThreshold`? The test It looks for the modal in each submission, and only completes the test when/if it finds one.

That is why the suggestion would fail since the donation modal would not exist on the first submission: Thanks for the suggestion. I updated the naming accordingly. 
 Right, but I think you want to test if the donation modal is ever shown and fail if it doesn't. This test doesn't do that.

In fact the test cannot fail:

- If modal is not visible, skip assertion -> pass
- If modal IS visible, check if visible (it is!) -> pass

What I think you want is to have a variable `isDonationShown`, initially set to false, set it to true if the modal pops up and assert that it's true at the end. I see, I changed the test accordingly. "

Do you mean something like this?
```js
flex={hasVerticalResizableCodePane ? codePane.flex : 1.0}

Btw. This doesn't work:

``` I did a little digging into the Reflex source and it maps the `flex` property onto `flex-grow`. It doesn't really expect us to mess around with the details.

There are a couple of underlying problems that I think are behind this. The separation of concerns is not very clear and we're abusing `useEffect`.

## (lack of) separation of concerns
The Scene component is doing a lot. It's handling the animation, setting up the audio, starting the animation + audio and finally rendering. I reckon it would be easier to reason about if it's only responsible for rendering and starting the animation + audio. We can put the animation/audio elsewhere. Something like https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#there-is-more-than-one-way-to-do-it

## `useEffect` abuse
Not just here, but we tend to reach for `useEffect` whenever we want to trigger side effects. While this can be a valid approach, it often isn't. Particularly in this case when we actually want to do is respond to a user event. The canonical way of doing that is via say, an `onClick` handler.  In short, I click on the play button and that starts the animation and audio.

## However
This is quite a big set of changes, so it's something for the future, not this PR. I'm not convinced that those underlying problems were the cause of this though, but I'm not sure. Perhaps not, but it's something I think we should do before trying to make any changes to the feature (letting people stop or restart the dialog, say). This one good to go @ojeytonwilliams ?LGTM üëç  Reviewed it on an IOS emulator, works like a charm. @moT01 it doesn't feel right to approve something I can't actually check, but I can at least confirm that nothing's broken on Chrome :shrug: ","LGTM üëç  Reviewed it on an IOS emulator, works like a charm. @moT01 it doesn't feel right to approve something I can't actually check, but I can at least confirm that nothing's broken on Chrome :shrug: ","The `canplaythrough` event wasn't firing on pages where the audio `startTimestamp` was `0` - only on ios browsers.

While translating this file, I noticed that Crowdin wanted us to translate all the solution JS code. Here are some examples:

(The grey text on the left means it should not be translated. The yellow and blue text means it should be translated.)

After some checking, I noticed that the solution JS code block does not have the ending backticks. This might be why Crowdin treats the JS code as regular text and asks us to translate it. 

This PR adds the ending backticks.

So, I was going to leave a review comment or two, but I just wanted to play with it a bit locally. Now here we are :cold_sweat: 

I explained a little in the commit message, but to reiterate: it seemed like this was mixing concerns a bit. The session storage module really was just responsible for storing the current completed challenge count and saving it for later comparison. That doesn't have any direct connection to donation logic. It can (and should!) be completely ignorant of how it's going to be used and still work well.

I moved the responsibility for checking if we saved anything into the module. Also, if so, it's responsible for tracking how many challenges have been completed since we saved. Again, neither seemed to have much to do with donation and they fit with the other features of the module.

The end result is a bit more cohesive and easier to understand.

Let me know what you think and if anything seems like a terrible idea or is broken! @ojeytonwilliams, thanks for taking a look. Your version LGMT.

There's a lot to do before this is robust, but with this small change you can render inline JSX. This does mean that every challenge that uses `type=""text/babel""` will compile JSX, but I plan to fix that soon. Also, there aren't any challenges that use it at the moment.

For future reference, I tried to do this without making use of our transformation pipeline, but I couldn't see a nice way to handle imports. Typically what you do is import the module

```html
<script
   data-plugins=""transform-modules-umd""
   type=""text/babel""
   src=""thing-you-want.js"">
</script>
```

and then use that module

```html
 <script
   data-plugins=""transform-modules-umd""
   data-type=""module""
   type=""text/babel""
>
   import { thing } from './thing-you-want.js';
 </script>
 ```

but `thing-you-want.js` doesn't exist and so the first script doesn't attach the ""module"" to the global scope in a way that the importing script can use (via its ""moduleId"").  You can create custom presets for `transform-modules-umd`, to force the  moduleId, but you need one per file you'd like to import and it gets messy quickly.

I could be missing something obvious, but for now it seems easier to rely on the transformation pipeline.

 Thanks for tagging me. I don't have hard data, but I think it would be useful to the user to see the error when correcting it. 
We could display a loader, show a skeleton, or even lower the opacity of the text in the lower jaw (other than the main button) for the loading state between hints so the user is notified that the changes have been submitted.  Thanks for catching that, @Sembauke. The latest version should make the two approaches consistent.

@ahmaxed okay, cool. That sounds a little more out of scope than my already out of scope changes, so I've reverted to something closer to production.",,"- **fix(client): lower jaw annoucements**

The issue was caused by React batching renders for some events, but not others. Since it's not something we can (easily?) control, I tried to make sure that the lower jaw works regardless. i.e. if `attempts` changes on a separate render to `hint`, that's fine, and it should work if they change on the same render.

This _should_ keep the screen reader behaviour we want, but I'm not 100% sure what the desired behaviour actually is. It's quite possible I broke something, though I did check that Orca still reads the hints when you run the tests (and only once!)

The last commit changes the UX a bit, so I'm happy to either not do that or create a separate PR for it. @ahmaxed could you weigh in on the UX?

Thanks for your interest in contributing. We appreciate your efforts, but this PR doesn't follow [our guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/how-to-open-a-pull-request).

Do not worry, you should join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA) server and ask for help in the `#contributors` channel. That will help other contributors guide you to get your PR ready for a review. 

Happy Contributing!Please check the guidelines about commit titles: https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/how-to-open-a-pull-request/

Specifically, your commit message should start with `fix(‚Ä¶)` like your PR does.  Replied on discord but providing a copy of my message here for posterity:

It looks like you created a new commit and merged or something. My recommendation would be to reset back to the first commit (`git reset --hard 2dccd4267`) and then modify the commit message using `git commit --amend`. Then force push up to your fork (`git push origin --force`). That will provide a cleaner history and avoid a squash merge. 

We can probably fix it during the merge. But this might be good practice for you.

Thank you. And sorry for bothering you. I should have converted the PR to a draft on time.The workshop is off to a good start
Here is some early feedback from me üëç  As I was starting to get into step 6 and onwards, I ran into issues with the tests.
Unfortunately, the tests use a bunch of regex testing because functions weren't introduced by this point.
But that does lead to a lot of inflexible tests and correct answers that don't pass like this one

<img width=""861"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 11 15 33 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d00cb5f-a369-40b7-a15d-b20e988f9d29"">

A lot of these regex tests check for a very specific order, where order shouldn't matter like shown above. But also regex tests are very difficult to maintain and we have spent most of this year, cleaning up a whole bunch of regex tests in the beta JS curriculum. 

So I have moved this workshop further down to the functions module so we have much more flexibility with tests.

We should update this workshop to be this instead

```js
// this could probably just be one step right here IMO
const minIncomeForDuplex = 60000;
const minCreditScoreForDuplex = 700;

const minIncomeForCar = 30000;
const minCreditScoreForCar = 650;

const minIncomeForCondo = 45000;
const minCreditScoreForCondo = 680;


// have step to create function

// for all of the tests dealing with conditions, call the function and use assert.equal to check that the correct string was returned

// have step to create first conditon and return statement
// have step to create second conditon and return statement
// have step to create third conditon and return statement
// have step to create fourth conditon and return statement

function getLoanMessage(annualIncome, creditScore) {

  if (
    annualIncome >= minIncomeForDuplex &&
    creditScore >= minCreditScoreForDuplex
  ) {
    return ""You qualify for a car, duplex and Condo loan""
  } else if (
    annualIncome >= minIncomeForCondo &&
    creditScore >= minCreditScoreForCondo
  ) {
    return ""You qualify for a car and condo loan""
  } else if (
    annualIncome >= minIncomeForCar &&
    creditScore >= minCreditScoreForCar
  ) {
    return ""You qualify for a car loan""
  } else {
    return ""You don't qualify for any loans""
  }
}

// have multiple steps to have campers update arguments to test the function
const loanMsg = getLoanMessage(75000, 720)

console.log(loanMsg);
```

This will make testing 100 times easier and you shouldn't need any regex tests except for the final console statement. üëç  Left some final comments but otherwise it looks good LGTM üëç  Existing labs have been removed from the `intro.json`, so it needs to be fixed.

","you need to add an intro here like the other workshops have this will technically be a review because there are other projects and lectures that tech conditionals before this prompt is no longer used in this workshop I think this should be expanded to say that the app checks for eligibility based on their income and credit score Any time we have them use `let` because of reassignment, we should mention that.
Because in the past, campers didn't always know why they were writing `let` over `const` and they just felt like they were following directions without knowing why.  for here, I don't think we should care that much if they use `const`, `let`, or `var` really.
I think the only time we should care, is when we need them to reassign values. Then we should specify `let`.
Otherwise, we should only care that they created the variables. 

The lecture videos will be able to go into depth on when to use `let` and `const` and the differences between them. same here.
they can use whatever (`var`, `let`, or `const`) to create the variables.
 we can remove this because remember there are other workshops and labs before this where they practice working with conditionals.  also, there are lecture videos that discuss this too. so they won't need the example here I don't know if we will need this example either.
because there will be a lecture video and labs before this where they will learn about logical operators I feel like step 6 and step 7 could be combined here because campers will have previous practice in earlier projects I feel like steps 14 and 15 should be combined We should make this more flexible because campers will know multiple ways to concatenate strings and variables.
because technically this should be a valid answer

```js
`You qualify for the following loan(s):\n\n${loanMessage}`

```

we should update that message to allow for multiple correct answers

 same thing here.
campers should be allowed to input any correct answer.
we should only check that they got the correct string format.
how, they choose to concatenate strings, whether it be template literals or `+` operator is up to them We should mention that they need to update the values to pass the test here

maybe something like this

```suggestion
Now it is time to test out your loan qualification checker. Update the values for the `annualIncome` and `creditScore` variables to see the different loan messages. You can update the values to whatever positive integers you like.
``` same here.
we should update this to account for multiple correct answers for string concatenation. I'm Tobassum a front end dev I will look into this when I start writing the tests This just checks for that string in particular. It's not concatenating any variable. we should explain what a credit score is for people who don't know.

```suggestion
The app will check whether the user is eligible for a duplex, car, and condo loan based on their annual income and credit score. A credit score is a number that represents how good you are at managing borrowed money.
``` only use regex test when you have.
here, you have a better option

```suggestion
assert.equal(annualIncome, 55000);
``` only use regex test when you have.
here, you have a better option

```suggestion
assert.equal(creditScore, 650);
``` only use regex test when you have.
here, you have a better option

```suggestion
assert.equal(minIncomeForDuplex, 60000);
``` ```suggestion

``` only use regex test when you have.

","""these"" is quite cryptic Maybe we should say somewhere that we are talking about a data type. Also, a mutable one. What if we ask to print the list after appending the new item? ```suggestion
You can also access a single element to get its value.
``` ```suggestion
To access an element you use bracket notation. For example `example_list[1]` is accessing the element at index `1`, the second element, of `example_list`.
``` ```suggestion
The lists are zero-indexed like strings are, that means that the first element is at index `0`, the second element is at index 1 and so on.
``` It is evident now, but maybe we should say that lists can hold different data types. ```suggestion
The `.insert()` method can add an element at any position in a list, the first argument is the position at which the element has to be added, and the second argument is the element to add. For example, let's add a new element in the third position of `example_list`.
```
Considering what we said about making consistent the way we refer to methods/functions. Not sure about the dot, at this point. What is the right position? Does it need to be ordered? Do we want to use `<dfn>` here? ```suggestion
`my_list` should have two elements inside.
``` Maybe I would mention again to use the comma to separate the values. ```suggestion
You can add an item to the end of a list using the `append()` method. For example:
``` ```suggestion
The lists are zero-indexed like strings are. That means that the first element is at index `0`, the second element is at index `1` and so on.
``` ```suggestion
Another thing you can do with bracket notation is change an element value.
``` ```suggestion
For example, the line `example_list[1] = 'oh'` will make `example_list` have value of `[4, 'oh', 6, 7]`.
``` Maybe it would be better to show the initial value of `example_list` or say that the `5` has been replaced by that string. ```suggestion
The `insert` method can add an element at any position in a list. The first argument is the position at which the element has to be added, and the second argument is the element to add. For example, here's how to add a new element in the third position of `example_list`:
``` I think we should say something more precise if we want the list to be ordered. Although is pretty intuitive. ```suggestion
One last important method, for now, is the `pop()` method. `pop()` can be used to remove an element from a list. By default, it removes the last element of the list, but you can pass an argument to the method and it will remove the element at the given index.
``` I'm so glad you removed ""tomato"". ```suggestion
In this case, `fruits_list.pop(2)` removes the element at index `2` of the list.
``` ```suggestion
Different from numbers and strings, a <dfn>list</dfn> is a data type that works as a container for other values:
```

Also ""data type"" shouldn't be hyphenated. ```suggestion
Python lists are mutable which means that the value of the list items can be changed.
You can change an element's value using the bracket notation.
``` ```suggestion
A list can contain different data types: `[1, ""Up"", [""Down"", ""Twice]]`. That includes all possible data types. It can also contain an other list!
``` ```suggestion
To add items to a list, you can write them between the parenthesis, separating the values with commas.

Add the numbers `1` and `2` inside the list.
``` ```suggestion
Lists are zero-indexed like strings are. That means that the first element is at index `0`, the second element is at index `1` and so on.
``` ```suggestion
To access an element you use bracket notation. For example, `example_list[1]` is accessing the element at index `1`, the second element, of `example_list`.
``` ```suggestion
You can change the value of an element using the bracket notation.
``` ```suggestion
Unlike numbers and strings, a <dfn>list</dfn> is a data type that works as a container for other values:

As I understand we are not going to add it in each lab. ```suggestion

As we decided to let campers write the link and the script themselves ```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
1. There should be a `p` element with the `id` of `char-count`. It should initially contain the text `Character Count: 0/50`. This placeholder text should be replaced with the current count of characters in the `textarea` element.
```
I would use `char-count` instead. ```suggestion
You should have a `p` element with the `id` of `char-count`. 
```
Following the previous comment. ```suggestion
assert($('p').attr('id') == 'char-count');
``` ```suggestion
You should select the character count display element by its id `char-count` and store it in the variable `charCountDisplay`.
``` ```suggestion
You should update the `#char-count` text to show the current character count using `innerHTML` and using the string template `Character Count: ${charCount}/50`.
``` ```suggestion
        <p id=""char-count"">Character Count: 0/50</p>
``` ```suggestion
#char-count {
``` ```suggestion
  let charCountDisplay = document.getElementById(""char-count"");
``` ```suggestion
The `#char-count` `p` element should initially contain the text `Character Count: 0/50`.
``` As Jessica mentioned, one can use `querySelector` instead of `getElementById`. But also, you can get the element and store it in a variable and have `<variableName>.addEventListener` ```suggestion
1. You should have a `textarea` element with the `id` of `text-input`. It should have a `placeholder` attribute with the text `Type something...`.
```
I would use `text-input` in place of `textInput` ```suggestion
1. You should attach an event listener to the `text-input` element that listens for the `input` event. 
``` ```suggestion
You should have a `textarea` element with the `id` of `text-input`. 
``` ```suggestion
assert($('textarea').attr('id') == 'text-input');
``` ```suggestion
You should attach an event listener to the `text-input` element.
``` ```suggestion
Your event listener on `#text-input` should listen for the `input` event.
``` ```suggestion
Inside the event trigger function, you should create a condition that checks if the current character count is greater than `50`. 
``` ```suggestion
<script src=""script.js""></script>
</body>
``` ```suggestion
        <textarea id=""text-input"" placeholder=""Type something...""></textarea>
``` ```suggestion
const textInput = document.getElementById('text-input');
const charCount = document.getElementById('char-count');

textInput.value = ""hello coder"";
textInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
textInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'));

assert.strictEqual(charCount.innerText.trim(), 'Character Count: 11/50');
```

We need to fire the ""input"" event too, which is what the solution code listens for. Also, neither of these will really help if we don't change the *value* of the text input first. :3 This test is passing even if nothing is entered in the text area. I was expecting something different, this test works! ```suggestion
If character count is greater than or equal to `50`, the user shouldn't be able to enter more characters.
``` ```suggestion
textInput.value = ""I am learning a new programming language and it is called c++."";
textInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
textInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'));
assert.strictEqual(textInput.value.length, 50);
```

This test wasn't working quite right. The string you had was exactly 50 characters, we want to make sure that a string longer than 50 isn't allowed."

We could do something similar to the current pyramid generator project where we give a brief intro into what they are going to do

We could also do this for all DOM projects where the HTML and CSS is provided for them
 > I wasn't sure if that was only for labs but I can add that in

Yea, the labs should have a `demoType` of `onClick` I believe - that will show the button to open the preview. And step-1 of the workshops should have a `demoType` of `onLoad` I believe (assuming we want it) - which opens the preview on that step. [See step-1 of the current quiz project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/main/curriculum/challenges/english/14-responsive-web-design-22/learn-accessibility-by-building-a-quiz/614ccc21ea91ef1736b9b578.md) - and [see it in action](https://www.freecodecamp.dev/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-accessibility-by-building-a-quiz/step-1) I will work on applying the other changes tomorrow üëç  > step5 - The getRoundResults function is started for me. We could add another step and let the users create that?

The issue with that is there is no good way to test that they created variable and assigned it the result of called the `getRoundResults`. We would have to use regex tests here, which I don't think we should do here

```js
function getRoundResults(userOption) {
  const computerResult = getRandomComputerResult();
 
}
```

even if we try to update step 6 to have them create the function and mention that they should create a variable of their choice and assign that function call, the directions are already long enough as is. So my concern of adding another sentence of two will make it to long and crowded.



This is pretty awesome @jdwilkin4 üéâ I have number of suggestions...

I would like to see a little more directing users to play with the app. There‚Äôs a little of that in there, which is nice - but at the beginning or end of the instructions on some more steps, you could add some more‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIf you try to play the game now, [describe functionality]‚Äù or ‚ÄúAfter you finish, test your game, you will see [functionality]‚Äù Just a suggestion, no need to add any more - like I said, there is some of that in there already.

No need to do this one either, just a suggestion again. It feels like I'm thrown into the middle of the project a bit. On step 1, you could maybe describe the boilerplate given to them and tell them to look at it - and what functionality they will add. Or maybe even have a few steps at the beginning to have them finish up the HTML so they can see the buttons and things they are adding. I think what's bothering me is that I am not familiar with the boilerplate and don't have an overview of what code I have or quite what I am going to build. I'm not sure what the solution to that is. Wonder if we should add the `demoType: onLoad` here? was that left out intentionally? It might help a bit.

step5 - The `getRoundResults` function is started for me. We could add another step and let the users create that?

Step7 - didn‚Äôt pass with this code:
```
‚Ä®‚Ä®function showResults(userOption) {
  playerScoreSpanElement.innerText = playerScore;
  computerScoreSpanElement.innerText = computerScore;
  roundResultsMsg.innerText = getRoundResults(userOption);
}
```
It passed when I moved the last line (the roundResults‚Ä¶) to the top of the function. The instructions should change to specify the order these should be in, or the tests should change to allow any order.

Step 9 - maybe change the wording. Instead of ‚Äú...you should call the showResults function...‚Äù maybe ‚Äú...you should run a function that calls the showResults function‚Ä¶‚Äù

Not all of the suggestions are necessary, I think steps 7, 9, and 11 should probably get some adjustments. Let me know if you have any thoughts on any of it. LGTM @jdwilkin4 üéâ It's pretty fun üëç

I still think I would prefer to see step 6 broken up into two steps and use a regex test there if needed.

Also, it feels a little... strange that step 1 doesn't have a task to complete. It would be nice if we could bake a task in with the description - but it's pretty long already, so I'm fine with it.

I'm going to go ahead and merge this. Those feel like preferences - we can make adjustments on another PR if we really want to.","This is pretty awesome @jdwilkin4 üéâ I have number of suggestions...

    <title>Styled To-Do List</title>
``` ```suggestion
**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
```
Maybe I missed something but I thought that part shouldn't be added in each lab. ```suggestion
All of the `input` elements should have an `id`.
``` It's passing on the seed code It's passing on the seed code I would add another tests that says ""You should have four list items in your unordered list."" ```suggestion
Each list item should contain an `input` element with the type `checkbox`.
```
After adding another hint before this I would reword it for two reasons: the label can be placed before the input, and now you are allowed to pass the test if you put the unordered list before the label.

So if you want the `ul` after the `label` but not necessarily contiguous, the sentence is fine but I would verify that the `ul` comes after the `label`. It does not pass with `a { text-decoration: none}`.
I would try something different since you are not interested in the selector used to target anchor elements:
```suggestion
const links = document.querySelectorAll(""a"");
[...links].forEach((link) => {
    assert(getComputedStyle(link).textDecoration.startsWith(""none""));
});
``` Shouldn't it be `a:hover`? @Dario-DC 
This test didn't work. Based on the discussion in the group, i'll leave this here for now. done! I have left this hint as it is, but made the test a bit specific:

Now, `label + ul.sub-item` would select all `ul` elements that:
- Directly follow a `label` element in the DOM.
- Have the class `sub-item`. I updated the test, but it has room for improvement. ```suggestion
**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
``` ```suggestion
4. You shouldn't apply any list styles to the unordered lists.
5. Your anchor elements shouldn't have any default text decoration.
6. You should set the text color of the links to a color of your choice.
7. When your links are visited, the color should change to another color of your choice.
8. When your links are hovered over, the color should change to another color of your choice.
9. When your links are focused, there should be a colored outline around the link.
10. When your links are clicked, the color should change to another color of your choice.
``` ```suggestion
   - A list item with an `anchor` element in it. The `anchor should have the class `sub-item-link`, a valid `href` value, and a `target` value that makes the link open in a new tab.
``` These tests all require using the `.sub-item-link` selector. So if I just use `a` or `a.sub-item-link`, the tests don't pass. We should either change the text to specifically say to use the `.sub-item-link` selector (might want to add it to the user stories if we go that route), or make the tests more flexible. I have made the tests flexible by targeting `a.sub-item-link`, `.sub-item-link`, and `a`. ```suggestion
2. Inside the unordered list, you should have four list items.
``` ```suggestion
   - A list item with an anchor element in it. The anchor should have the class `sub-item-link`, a valid `href` value, and a `target` value that makes the link open in a new tab.
``` I'm not sure what this one is supposed to mean. Does it mean I should use `list-style: none;` or am I not supposed to change the default list-style. If so, I would reword this to something like ""You should remove the default list style from your unordered lists.""

And we could add a test for it if so. Also, is it supposed to apply to all the UL's? or just the main UL? I would make it so it's just the main one. ""You should remove the default list style from your `.todo-list`"" This instruction is supposed to remove the default style from the main unordered list. The campers can add any style to the other list inside and it is optional.

I have updated the instruction and added a new test.
It works for both:

```css
.todo-list {
    list-style: none;
}
```

```css
.todo-list {
    list-style-type: none;
}

We're happy to accept these changes, and look forward to future contributions. üìù üéâ Tested locally, works like a charm. Hi @Inventoris, thanks for taking the time to fix this. However, I think the root of the problem is that the `createFiles` action has too many jobs - it should put the challenge files in the redux store and nothing else.

If we do that, and update the ui via another action (`initVisibleEditors`, say), there's no need for any conditionals in the reducer and no chance of weird interactions. Perfect. Thanks, @Inventoris

Hi! I looked into the issue and noticed that when saving the code, createFiles is executed, in which visibleEditors is set to one main tab by default. I added code so that if state.visibleEditors contains current tabs at the time createFiles is launched, then visibleEditors will contain exactly them.","```suggestion

If the title is going to be changed into `Build a Moon Orbit` Aren't we going to provide the boilerplate at this point? ```suggestion
assert(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.earth')?.backgroundColor);
```
This test is passing once the `.earth` selector is added to the stylesheet, even if `background-color` is not used. ```suggestion
assert(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.earth')?.borderRadius);
``` ```suggestion
assert(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.moon')?.backgroundColor);
``` ```suggestion
assert(new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getStyle('.moon')?.borderRadius);
``` Also, to make it look like a circle maybe we should check that the value is set to 50%. What do you think? ```suggestion
The `moon` `div` should have a width and height of `30px`.
```
I guess it was not supposed to be there I thought the campers would add it themselves. I have provided one now. ```suggestion
The contents of the `body` element should be centered on the page by setting the height to `100%` of the viewport height, `display` to `flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to `center`.
``` ```suggestion
``` I think we can include the `link` tag in the seed code at this point. ```suggestion
1. You should align all the elements to the center of the page by setting the height to `100%` of the viewport and setting a flexbox layout in the `body` element.
```
""relevant rules"" seems too generic. I'd prefer to mention flexbox in some way. I had some difficulties to understand that. Can we reword it in some way? ```suggestion
        ""title"": ""Build a Moon Orbit"",
``` ```suggestion
  ""name"": ""Build a Moon Orbit"",
``` I have split this hint into two. @jdwilkin4 

Is it OK to use this naming convention? Yeah, I think this name works üëç  Even though we have a demo, a short explanation would be nice too. It will bring better context to what they are seeing in the demo.

In this lab, you will create an animated solar system using HTML and CSS. You will create a simple solar system with the Earth and the Moon. The Earth will be at the center of the system, and the Moon will orbit around it.

``` I wouldn't say that. Solar system refers to the Sun and the bodies orbiting around it.

What about this?

Considering that we decided to remove the link from the seed code. ```suggestion
7. The `earth` `div` should use `absolute` positioning. Position the center of the `earth` `div` at the halfway point of its parent on both the vertical (top) and horizontal (left) axes. After that, shift the `earth` `div` back by half its own width and height, to center it within its parent, `.space`.
``` Yeah, that fine. As long as we provide something so campers will know what they are getting into.

IMO, most of these labs should have descriptions because we want to make sure that campers understand what they are building.  This one can maybe be deleted? I don't see a tests for it and I didn't add it to my project and it turned out as expected I think. I have removed it."

Now, the project:
- asks camper to assign a predefined email address.
- checks if required variables are defined.
- does not limit the campers to one solution.
 @moT01 

This is one of the early labs.
So campers only know strings at this point. 
So no functions.

But an easy way to test to make sure they don't hardcode the result, would be to use an assert.notMatch with a small regex > Otherwise, maybe we can check that they use some string methods on their email variable or something.

As long as this doesn't lead to a fixed solution type of situation with a whole bunch of long regex tests.

All of these labs should allow campers to freely experiment and think for themselves how to approach the problem and use what ever string methods applicable to solve it.

If we start prescribing to much to them, then it just leads to them right back in tutorial hell and they are not problem solving and creating on their own

That is where my main concern always lies with the labs and the workshops to an extent. 

I want campers to have as many opportunities to submit multiple viable answers because that is the only way they will grow and learn. 
I left some comments on how this could be restructured so this could adhere more to the spirit and purpose of the labs. 

The goal of all of these JS labs is to have them problem solve and come up with their own solutions with very little restrictions. That is where the learning comes in. Through trial and error and experimentation.

They should be able to use whatever variables name they want here and whatever string methods that get the job done.

For example, this valid solution using `substring` would not pass your current tests and user stories even though it does mask the email address.

```js
const email = ""apple.pie@example.com"";

const atIndex = email.indexOf(""@"");
const userName = email.substring(0, atIndex);
const domain = email.substring(atIndex);

const maskedName = userName[0] + ""*"".repeat(userName.length - 2) + userName.slice(-1);
const finalMaskedEmail = maskedName + domain;

console.log(finalMaskedEmail);
```
Or they could be adventurous and come up with a solution using `replace` which was taught before this.

```js
const email = ""apple.pie@example.com"";

const maskedEmail = email.replace(/^(.)(.*)(.)(@.*)$/, (match, firstChar, middleChars, lastChar, domain) => {
  return `${firstChar}${'*'.repeat(middleChars.length)}${lastChar}${domain}`;
});

console.log(maskedEmail);

```
Our tests should only care about the final outputs. How they get there is up to them

So the way I see it we should only care about the following:
	‚Ä¢	do they have a variable called¬†email¬†and have assigned to it the value of¬† ""apple.pie@example.com""
	‚Ä¢	do they have a variable called¬†maskedEmail¬†and have they assigned it the result of masking the email using whatever string methods they want to.
	‚Ä¢	do they log that maskedEmail` to the console
 I was able to pass with this code:

```
let email = 'apple.pie@example.com';
const maskedName = 'a*******e@example.com';
console.log(maskedName);
```

Could we use a function here?

```
mask(email) {
  // user logic here
}
```

And the tests could be
`mask('helloWorld@email.com') should return 'h********d@email.com'`
`mask('helloWorld2@email.com') should return 'h********2@email.com'`

Or can we not use functions at this point?

Otherwise, maybe we can check that they use some string methods on their email variable or something. This LGTM üéâ It was fun üëç 

The only suggestion I have would be to change the second user story to not ask them to have a `maskedName` variable. It doesn't matter how users get there, as long as the function works. But I'm fine with keeping it as well.

","some non native english speakers might not know what masking means. 

```suggestion
          ""In this lab, you'll build an email masker that will take an email address and obscure it.""
``` The issue I see with this approach is that the user could technically assign any value to the email variable and we have no user stories or tests to check for that.

They could do something like this:

```js
const email = ""something random""
const email = ""alskdjlskjflkj2304983""
// not even a string
const email = 9
```

so to make our lives easier, I vote we have them create an `email` variable and assign it the value `""apple.pie@example.com""`
that way, for the rest of the tests we will know for sure we are working with a valid email address format We should combine all of these user stories into just one.
Because all we should care about is testing the final result.
The specific implementation and details should be left to the camper. 

Something like this could work. Or something along these lines.

```suggestion
2. You should create a variable called `maskedName` and assign it the result of masking the `email`.  Remember that you can use methods like `slice`, `repeat`, `indexOf` `slice` or even `replace` to help you.
``` ```suggestion
6. Log the `maskedName` variable to the console. 
``` We should provide a description with an example here so they better understand.

```suggestion
# --description--

In this lab, you will mask the username part of an email address with asterisks. Masking is a term used to hide or replace sensitive information with asterisks or other characters.

For example, if the email address was `myEmail@email.com`, then the masked email address will be `m*******l@email.com`.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 
``` we should update the tests to match the outlines suggestions I mentioned earlier.

 I am reopening this because the user story doesn't match the hint.
it should say to assign to assign `apple.pie@example.com` to it we should add another user story to make sure they don't hardcode the result like Tom mentioned earlier.
I would suggest experimenting with `assert.notMatch` I agree with Tom here about the maskedName.
We were using that earlier because this lab originally didn't have functions.
But now that is does, we don't need it any more Thank you for this suggestion, Tom and Jessica. 
We won't need that user story now. I have updated the PR."

2. You should select a random number between 1 and 5, inclusive, and assign it to the variable `randomNumber`.
```

When you put a list in between your numbers, it thinks you're starting a new list of numbers - so you have to put the specific numbers in this case. I would remove this user story and the tests - and let users print the variable in any way they like. ```suggestion
- `""Your cat will look very cuddly today.""`
- `""The weather will be nice tomorrow.""`
- `""Be cautious of your new neighbours.""`
- `""You will find a new hobby soon.""`
- `""It would be wise to avoid the colour red today.""`
```

Pretty minor, but two periods in a row looks weird to me. ```suggestion
3. You should log the fortune to the console in this manner:

- If `randomNumber` is 1, print the `fortune1`.
- If `randomNumber` is 2, print the `fortune2`.
- If `randomNumber` is 3, print the `fortune3`.
- If `randomNumber` is 4, print the `fortune4`.
- If `randomNumber` is 5, print the `fortune5`.
```

I would combine these somehow. I would include a regex test for `math.random` or something - so they don't just assign it a number. If you remove the if/else user story, you can remove these tests. ```suggestion
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /console\s*\.\s*log\s*\(\s*selectedFortune\s*\)\s*;?/);
```

","this should be JavaScript We should add a sentence or two explaining what a factorial is because a lot of campers might not know or remember from math class years ago I think this should be simplified to ask for the prompt method instead of prompt window

```suggestion
1. You should ask the user for a number using the `prompt` method and store the number in a variable called `inputNumber`.
``` I was playing around with this locally and I noticed a few things missing.

Technically the user can input anything

<img width=""950"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-19 at 11 21 48 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22532e62-7e71-401f-b43a-7ecd105ad6c5"">

But also, prompt will return a string
<img width=""952"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-19 at 11 22 44 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010bf3c7-9af4-4d9f-85e5-4c4f7b22347e"">

So this solution as well as the user stories will need to be updated to check for the following:

- we should have campers write an condition to check that the input is not an empty string
- then campers will need to convert the input to a number and check that it is not NaN

<img width=""844"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-19 at 11 26 30 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00dfb2d5-c22b-4e61-9653-8c44b71c30c9"">

if the user does not provide a valid input for either of those conditions above, then they should be prompted again until they do provide a valid input.

 we should allow for any type of loop here.
we should only care that they use some sort of loop and get the correct final result

```suggestion
3. Using a loop, loop through all numbers from `1` to `inputNumber` (inclusive) and for each number, multiply the `result` variable by the current number and assign the result to the `result` variable. You can choose to use  either a `for` loop, `while` loop or `do...while` loop here.
``` campers will also know about isNaN at that point if you wanted them to check using that ```suggestion
You should have a `num` variable.
``` ```suggestion
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /result\s*=\s*1\s*;?\s?$/m);
``` ```suggestion
3. Using a loop, loop through all numbers from `1` to `num` (inclusive) and for each number, multiply the `result` variable by the current number and assign the result to the `result` variable. You can choose to use  either a `for` loop, `while` loop or `do...while` loop here.
``` I would ask to assign a generic number here ```suggestion
assert.equal(resultMsg, 'Factorial of 5 is 120');
``` After discussion in the chat room, we decided to use a predefined number here. do we need a regex here?
assert.equal should work since result is a global variable right? One of the reasons why I suggested using 5 is because that is a reasonable number for a factorial.

What we don't want is for the user to pick 1,000,000 or something like that.

If we want users to pick their own number we do need to put limits. So I vote the limit be 20. That seems reason for this exercise.

Then we would just need to test for the following:
- `num` should actually be a number and not some sort of string, or anything else
- the number needs to be a positive number between 1 -20

those should be easy to test with built in chai assert methods `assert.equal` didn't work here as expected, maybe because it is reassigned later on. you should use the isNumber method instead you should use the isFunction method intead I am not sure we need a test specifically for this.
I think it is fine to talk about it in the user stories. But I don't think a test for it is necessary we should add another test and hint here to check for multiple correct results. This also prevents any forms of hardcoding or writing specifically to the tests by campers

something like this

````md
Your `factorialCalculator` should produce the correct result.

```js
assert.strictEqual(factorialCalculator(6), 720);
assert.strictEqual(factorialCalculator(9), 362880);
assert.strictEqual(factorialCalculator(11), 39916800);
```
```` also, technically they could solve this recursively, even though it hasn't been taught yet.
So the mentions of the different loops in the user stories are more for extra hints in case the campers isn't sure where to get started üëç  This should be moved out of the user stories and just above the description"

I have updated the tests and instructions to allow any parameter for the function.I know this is still a draft, but here are some early feedback from me.

In general, we want to keep these user stories as open ended as possiible to allow for multiple correct solutions based on what they learned so far.

Same goes for the testing. 
We don't want to test for one specific solution because that defeats the point of the labs.
The labs are the campers opportunity to practice their skills in an open ended way.

","I vote we add a description here on what a leap year actually since some people might not know. technically this could also be solved with a ternary which they will have learned about before this lab.
So I vote we update the directions to say they can use an if else or ternary I think we should leave off the `if` statement part because technically this would be a valid solution

```js
const year = 2024;
const isLeapYear = (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0;
console.log(`${year} is ${isLeapYear ? ""a leap year"" : ""not a leap year""}.`);

``` should be js instead

```suggestion
  ""helpCategory"": ""JavaScript""
``` Numbers should be in backticks  @jdwilkin4 
Is there a way to get what is being printed to the console?
Or is there a way where we can run the user entered code and then match the results with a value? As of right now, no. Chai doesn't have a helpful function for that.

The easiest way is to have campers assign the result to the variable and then have them log the variable.
That still gives them the flexibility of using an if/else or ternary to output the correct string whether it is a leap year or not. ```suggestion
In this lab you will utilize conditional statements and loops to create a leap year calculator.
``` ```suggestion
2. Outside the function, declare a variable `year` that stores the value of the year you want to check.

","```suggestion
1. You should declare an empty array named `inventory` that will store product objects having a key `name` with the value of a string, and a key `quantity` with the value of an integer.
``` ```suggestion
1. If the product is not present in the inventory, the `addProduct` function should push the product to the `inventory` array and log the product name to the console, followed by a space and `added to inventory`.
``` ```suggestion
1. If the quantity after the subtraction is zero, `removeProduct` should remove the product object from the inventory. If the quantity in the inventory is not enough to perform the subtraction, the `removeProduct` function should log the string `Not enough <product-name> available, remaining pieces: <product-quantity>` to the console.
``` if the quantity after subtraction is 0, what does it need to be printed to the console? it's not clear I don't know if the level is already that, but if toLowerCase or toUpperCase have already been introduced, it may be good to ask for normalization of the name? Is there a way to remove comments? It's failing me
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f87f0b6d-2af9-4f26-8885-5e399b075943)
 It should log `Remaining <name> pieces: <quantity>` and then it should delete that object They've been already introduced. Where would you like to use them exactly? Done :+1: user stories now don't say to treat `milk` and `Milk` as the same item, so toLowerCase would help with that It makes sense to do it, I agree. But should I require the `name` value to be lowercase or `toLowerCase` should be used when comparing `name`s?

In other words, should `addProduct({name: ""NotLowercase"", quantity: 3})` be allowed? that's what you need to specify in userstories. I would make so that in inventory everything is lowercase, but it depends on what you want to specify ```suggestion
assert.equal(logArr[0], ""Remaining flour pieces: 15"");
``` ```suggestion
inventory.push({name: 'flour', quantity: 20});
``` I intentionally used different numbers to avoid hard coding. I've modified the code and user stories. Let me know what you think. approved"

","False positive, we can ignore this. While we're here, I wasn't sure if `ChallengeHeading` sounded like it meant ""Heading of a challenge"" rather than ""Heading to be used in challenges"".

How about StatusHeading, CompletionHeading or similar? Something that says what it is, rather than where it's used. ```suggestion
                      maxLength={blankAnswers[value].length + 3}
```
TS knows what type `value` has because of the conditional returns. Pretty sure it wasn't always this clever, but it is now. ```suggestion
                        value
``` ```suggestion
                      size={blankAnswers[value].length}
``` Since these aren't used, the css rules in fill-in-the-blank show.css can go. This was pre-existing, so I think it's a little outside the scope of this PR - I would prefer to leave it here. I plan on some more refactoring of these, so I can potentially try to change it in another PR. I don't know if I like either of those any better - what about `featureHeading` or `challengeTaskHeading`? To be clear, they are these headings in the challenges:

As for what to call them, it's just that they don't have anything to do with challenges beyond the fact they're used there. Not a big deal, obviously."

","This is now being returned for `typeof email !== 'string'`, which is not happening on the old api.

Also, where does `401` come from? I agree it should probably be that, but the old api does `400`. Yeah, the idea was just that if auth0 responds with `{ ok: true, email: 1 }` or something equally weird, we have no way of knowing how to handle that.  Given that the mobile app only looks at the response cookies and not the body it's safe to respond with basically anything, so I figured a generic error response would be okay. @Nirajn2311 can you confirm/deny?

However, it probably makes more sense to throw for anything other than `{ ok: true, email: ""some-string""}` and `{ ok: false}`, since those are the only two responses we can deal with.

As for the 401, it's a change, but the same argument applies: the mobile app does not care about status codes."

","`#number` is being used as a name rather than a value here, so the quotation marks aren't needed.

```suggestion
To begin, the `calculate` function needs to find the number that was entered in the `#numbers` input field. To do this, use a `.querySelector` to locate the input field and then use the `.value` property to get the number entered.
``` ```suggestion
To display the value of `mean`, your app has a `#mean` element ready to go.
``` ```suggestion
Your `.querySelector()` should target the `#mean` element.
``` ```suggestion
Your `calculate` function should set the `#mean` element's `.textContent` to the value of `mean`.

Declare a variable `median` and assign it the value of `getMedian(numbers)`. Then, query the DOM for the `#median` element and set the `textContent` to `median`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `calculate` function should query the DOM for the `#median` element and set the `textContent` to `median`.

This updates most of the assertions to be proper methods and removes jQuery methods. ","The more I think about these, the more I believe it'd be better to not use `&&` or `||` in these assertions and split them into two separate assertions.

It's getting confusing very quickly. This one is fine without the `!= null`, due to how `&&` works. If the first operand of `x && y` is _falsy_ it's get returned right away, otherwise the second operand is returned.
```javascript
code.match(/<\/figure>/g) && code.match(/<\/figure>/g).length === code.match(/<figure>/g).length
```
If `code.match(/<\/figure>/g)` doesn't match, it will be `null`, `null` is not `true`, so assertion fails, as expected - good. If it matches, then it's _truthy_, so second operand will be returned `code.match(/<\/figure>/g).length === code.match(/<figure>/g).length` can result as `true`, so all is good. But confusion increases. Which again, could be avoided with two assertions (or maybe just second one with optional chaining, not entirely sure at this moment). I do agree that optional chaining would help clean things up a lot. And maybe it would be better if some assertions were separate.  ```suggestion
assert.isNotNull(document.querySelector('#search')?.getAttribute('tabindex'));
``` ```suggestion
assert.isNotNull(document.querySelector('#submit')?.getAttribute('tabindex'));
``` ```suggestion
assert.equal(document.querySelector('#search')?.getAttribute('tabindex'), '1');

Thank you for this contributions, instead of only showing numbers, I think we should use the example (Test X:) that is described in the issue. Hey @Sembauke, in an earlier [discussion](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/54257#discussion_r1546584921), it was suggested to drop `Test` and just use the enumeration.

Closes #52724
This PR builds on the discussion from #54257
<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->

Added enumeration to challenge tests by inserting it into the test strings in `test-suite.tsx` for the instructions panel and `execute-challenge-saga.js` for the console output. I found an alternative solution that seems to achieve the same result by modifying the challenge markdown parsing. The code for that solution can be found [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/compare/main...kevin-wu01:freeCodeCamp:soln-test). I've opted for the former solution since it's less complex and aligns with what has been discussed. Though I'm happy to hear any additional thoughts.",

","Asking again because I'm not sure what we decided. Are we going to provide the boilerplate? This test passes without adding code. Maybe I am missing something. Is this different from the previous test ""You should have an `#email` selector that sets its elements' `width` to `500px`."" ? ```suggestion
1. Your `#confidential` and `#top-secret` elements should have a `padding`, a left margin, and a `border`.
```
I'd use either `margin-left` between backticks or ""margin left"" as simple text. The same holds for other occurrences. ```suggestion
Your `#confidential` element should have a left margin.
``` ```suggestion
Your `#top-secret` element should have a left margin.
``` The idea here was to get them to add `box-sizing: border-box` so the element + padding and border should be 500px.

That was a little tricky to test, so I adjusted the user story a little and changed the test to specifically check that. ```suggestion
1. Your `#email` element should have `padding` of `50px`, a top margin of `50px`, a `width` of `500px`, and a `border` that's `2px`.
```
For the same reason as `left-margin`. ```suggestion
1. You should have at least three `span` elements with a class of `blurred`, within your paragraph elements.

Full disclosure, the reason why I never updated this challenge is because the regex I was using might have some issues (might be catastrophic backtracking). If you remove the closing `</head>` tag and run the tests it can lock up.

I was going to update the tests with something better but never got around to it. I'm still not sure what the best solution is but it might be that we have to match on the specific elements and not `(?:.|\s*)*?`


Example of code that causes issues with the regex
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
  <head>
    <meta charset=""utf-8"">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles.css"">

I was translating this material and noticed that the word `backslash` is wrapped by backticks. This means that Crowdin does not allow me to translate it. However, `backslash` is just used to explain what `\` is and is not used in the code. So, I think the backticks can be removed for translation purposes.

I have made the following changes:

- Added a story and tests for linking style sheet to HTML.
- Trimmed the user stories and adjusted the tests accordingly.
- Fixed the failing test for Firefox.
- Improved vague instructions/ tests.In the HTML lab I added, I used the format `lab-recipe-page` for the block dashed name and filenames - it doesn't sound as good, but it keeps all the labs next to each other in the file tree - the URL will be `lab-recipe-page` though, so there's some trade-offs. The display name is still set in the intro.json file, so we can show whatever we want.

I think we should be consistent, so we should either change this to use that format, or I can change the other one. What do you think @zairahira? I just had a brief look. There are several tests that pass without adding any code. I was able to follow the instructions and pass all the tests, so I think I would be fine with this üëç I do have a number of suggestions.‚Ä®..

Since this is the first CSS project, we could maybe add a user story to ""link the styles.css file"". I don't know if it's needed, but I couldn't figure out why my styles weren't being applied for a bit. Maybe users will be used to it at this point.

I personally think the user stories and tests could be trimmed down quite a bit, and allow for more flexibility. For instance, many of the elements ask for a specific background color - similarly with font-size and other properties. This makes it so many user projects will end up looking very similar - I would prefer to have some more flexibility. Maybe just one or two where you give something specific and then allow anything in other areas - or not even include a user story if it's been covered. For instance, you could say ""The body should have a background color of rosybrown."" and then maybe ""other thing should have a background color set to something other than the default."" Or with the font-size, just have them set a font-size for one or two things, and leave out the others - and they can set it to anything if they want to or just leave it. The goal of implementing font-size would be accomplished.

I don't think that stuff needs to be added here, I'm just explaining how I think it could be better - kind of just a preference.

All that said, I did have fun doing it and it covers what it needs to üëç

 The project is looking good :+1:  I left a few comments.

Since this is about styling, I would also check that the image size is appropriate. Set its width should be enough. Hey @zairahira, since I'll be away for a bit and don't want to be in the way, I've left an approval.

I did notice one minor thing, though, but it's not blocking, imo.

``` ```suggestion
**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 
```
To keep the same format in all labs. ```suggestion
The links of the page should have no underline by default.
``` It always passes. It always passes. It always pass It always pass It always passes It always passes It always passes It always passes It always passes Maybe we should accept `margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;`, too. The issue about the order should be fixed, so you should be able to change this to whatever. Also, I updated the spreadsheet to fill in the block order - it looks like this one is 38 This test is failing in firefox for me with the solution. I don't think it has to be fixed, but it would be nice - maybe take a short look at it? I gave it a quick check, firefox computes it as `""Arial"", sans-serif` - so maybe we could allow either of the two values. I prefer to be vague where we can to challenge users, but I would like these to be more specific I think. If the tests are checking that the `body` has the correct value, then we should say that the body should have it - here and/or in the test, probably both. Because there's other ways to change the background color and font-family of the page. Unless maybe we are referring to the body as page in the stuff leading up to this, but I don't think we are.

I noticed some other areas with similar things. ""The image size should be `150px by 150px`"" for instance. We test that the `.profile-image` has that set, but there's other ways to set it - with just the `img` selector. We need to mention at least in the tests what is being tested for, or users won't know why it's failing if they use a different selector. ```suggestion
9. The second `p` element should contain your designation. Its `font-size` property should be `18px` and the `color` should be set to `gray`.
``` ```suggestion
6. Inside the `buisness-card` div, there should be an `img` element with the class `profile-image`. You can set the image source to `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/flower.jpg` if you like. There should be an `alt` with a meaningful description. The image size should be `150px` by `150px`. The bottom margin should be `10px` and there should be a `2px` solid `lightgray` border around the image.
``` ```suggestion
        <img src=""https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/flower.jpg"" alt=""A vibrant flower in full bloom"" class=""profile-image"">

        <p class=""company"">@freeCodeCamp</p>
``` ```suggestion
13. You should have another `div` with the class `social-media`. This div should have a top margin of `10px` and a font size of `14px`. The links inside this div should be `maroon` and should have a margin of `10px` all around. Within this element, there should be an `h2` element with the text `Connect with me`. 
``` ```suggestion

``` Once `img.profile-image`  is created this is always satisfied, even if you don't set the `src`.
I would check the length of the attribute instead. ```suggestion
Inside the `.business-card` element, after the `img` element, there should be a `p` element with the class `full-name`.
``` ```suggestion

The `.sort()` method mutates the original array - in other words, it modifies the order of the elements directly. This is generally considered bad practise, as it can result in unexpected side effects.

Instead, you should use the `.toSorted()` method, which creates a new array. Change your `.sort()` call to `.toSorted()`. Do not modify the callback function.

I have used this bug as an opportunity to teach campers about how to match multiple spaces in a row by adding a step specifically addressing this. ","It will also not match `10 dollars`, also after changes from this step.

I'm not sure I understand the intent regarding hard-coded single spaces. `/ +/` doesn't really differ from `/\s+/` in what it is used here for. I'm confused. Can you explain why it won't match `10 dollars` after this step? The intended solution is for dollarRegex to be equal to `/[0-9]+s\+(?:hundred|thousand|million|billion)?\s+dollars/i` after this step. 

As for the intent, the point is to keep things mentally clear. A plus sign before an literal empty space can be confusing and obnoxious to deal with. While distracted, it's really easy to get confused and ask ""Hey what's that space doing?"". Then hit backspace and get stuck on the challenge. Plus when trying to come up with an explanation of how the plus sign works, I'd like there to be a proper symbol to be there. I wanna be able to point at what's being repeated. 
 Oh yeah, that makes sense for space. It might be good to add more a bit more which characters other than literal space `\s` includes.

> I'm confused. Can you explain why it won't match `10 dollars` after this step? The intended solution is for dollarRegex to be equal to `/[0-9]+\s+(?:hundred|thousand|million|billion)?\s+dollars/i` after this step.

There's `\s+` before and after the optional group. That's one or more spaces twice. Okay. Now that I can see the issue, what's the best way to resolve the problem?  Not exactly sure, it's easy to make it much more complicated quickly: 
```regex
/[0-9]+\s+(?:(hundred|thousand|million|billion)\s+)?dollars/i
```

What do you think about changing the first `\s+` to `\s*`? 
```regex
/[0-9]+\s*(?:hundred|thousand|million|billion)?\s+dollars/i
```
Matching ie. `2hundred dollars` wouldn't be that bad, would it? I suppose it wouldn't be so bad.  ```suggestion
const dollarRegex = /[0-9]+\s*(?:hundred|thousand|million|billion)?\s+dollars/i;
``` ```suggestion
Your `dollarRegex` must not use literal spaces. 
``` ```suggestion
While this expression does match `1 hundred dollars`, it will not however match `1  hundred  dollars`, or `10 dollars`. Spam messages

can and will find a way to bypass flaws in our detector. Let's improve regex and replace the first literal space with a `\s*` expression and the second with a `\s+`. The `\s` represents a universal space character and the `+` means one 
``` ```suggestion
While this expression does match `1 hundred dollars`, it will not match `1  hundred  dollars`, or `10 dollars`.

Spam messages can and will find a way to exploit flaws in your detection. Time to improve your regex.

Replace the first literal space with the `\s*` expression. The `\s` character class matches whitespace, such as spaces, tabs, and new lines. The `*` quantifier means ""match the previous character 0 or more times"".

Replace the second literal space with `\s+`. The `+` quantifier means ""match the previous character at least one time"".
``` ```suggestion
Your `dollarRegex` must allow any number of spaces before the dollar quantity, and one or more spaces after.

The main change is to use page queries rather than static queries. Static queries aren't intrinsically bad, it's just that each one triggers a request to the origin if you reload a page that needs it.

For example if page A imports 3 components (each of which has a static query), then the first page load will fire off 3 requests. If page B also imports the same 3 components, then going from A -> B reuses the data (it doesn't re-request it), so it's not all bad.

The downside of switching to page queries is the following. It can increase the total size of our responses, even though we're always making fewer requests. In the example above page would make a page-data.json request including the data which we were getting via three static queries, but so will page B, since it also needs that data.

As long as we keep using Gatsby links, users should be fine, since the extra data will be prefetched, but it's worth considering.

Finally, etags help a bit, since subsequent visits to the same page will reused the cached data, i.e. A -> B -> A (uses cache), but they can't help with the first visits.

","We don't need the quotes here.

```suggestion
To display data in the `Activity` column, you need to use the `bumped_at` property of each topic, which is a timestamp in the ISO 8601 format. You need to process this data before you can show how much time has passed since a topic had any activity.
``` The quotes should be removed here. 

The instructions is talking about how we want the view count to be displayed. The displayed text doesn't contain the quotes, so with this change, campers might understood that they need to both change the string and wrap it in quotes.

```suggestion
You need a function to convert view counts to a more readable format. For example, if the view count is `1000`, it should display as `1k` and if the view count is `100,000` it should display as `100k`.
``` ```suggestion
Create a `viewCount` function with a `views` parameter. If `views` is greater than or equal to `1000`, return a string with the `views` value divided by `1000` and the letter `k` appended to it. Make sure to round `views / 1000` down to the nearest whole number.

Next, access the `#posts-container` element by using the `getElementById()` method. Assign it to a new constant called `postsContainer`.

Am I making this problem worse? I mean it's literally the only thing I could come up with at the time.  Not sure I understand the question.

The tests in this PR do not require semicolons. But if it had, that would have been a questionable solution. Semicolons should be optional, unless specifically chosen not to be for some educational reason. I think I just got confused about what the issue was about. You see for campers to pass these tests, they're going to need to insert semi-colons as that's how we can safely cut off content. 

I thought the issue meant that we should either enforce campers to consistently use semi-colons or not be strict about it.  > You see for campers to pass these tests, they're going to need to insert semi-colons as that's how we can safely cut off content.

The tests in this PR do not rely on semicolons, they are optional.

---

The issue you linked to is about semicolons in general. How we teach them, when to require them, etc. @gikf I was going to add something like that, but then I seemed to remember having tested it so I tested it again and the regex already supported the optional spaces.

In any case, having it explicit in the regex is probably a good idea. I just wanted to mention it because it caught me by surprise as well. @lasjorg Do you mean with latest changes, or before? @gikf Before (there are space on both sides of the semicolon btw).

","```suggestion
    ""hero-img-uis"": ""A group of screenshots showing the freeCodeCamp editor interface on both a mobile and desktop device and a certification."",
``` We aren't having tests for these so we should get rid of the test labels. And if we want to write tests for the display, we can just query the text using `getByText()` locator.

```suggestion
``` ```suggestion
    <Media minWidth={LARGE_SCREEN_SIZE}>
      <figure
        style={landingImageSize}
        data-test-label='landing-page-figure'
        data-playwright-test-label='landing-page-figure'
      >
        <LazyImage

          style={imageStyle}
        />
      </figure>
      <Spacer size='exLarge' />
    </Media>
```
No need for a fragment if there's just one child element. ```suggestion
const LandingA = () => (
  <main className='landing-page'>
    <LandingTop />
    <AsSeenIn />
    <Testimonials />
    <Certifications />
    <Faq />
  </main>
);
```
Cleaner, I think. Also, for trivial functions there's little to be gained from a return type annotation (you can see at a glance that it's a component). ```suggestion
const LandingB = () => (
  <main className='landing-page landing-page-b'>
    <LandingTopB />
    <Testimonials />
    <Certifications />
    <Faq />
  </main>
);
``` This doesn't work in development, since `value` is `null` meaning that we always end up showing the loader.

I'm not 100% sure, but my guess is the logic wants to be something like
```
  if (env.environment === 'development') return <LandingA />;
  if (feature.value === null) return <Loader fullScreen={true} />;
  if (feature.value) return <LandingB />;
  return <LandingA />;
  ```
  so that developers always see the old landing, but there's no ugly switch from A to B in production. I added a default set of features and re-arranged the logic. It should work now.  There aren't other `.mega-heading` overriding this one, so I think we can drop the `!important`.

```suggestion
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 0px 0px 1rem;
``` ```suggestion
    font-size: 3rem;
``` The border needs its color changed as well.

<img width=""345"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-08-10 at 03 40 51"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc4fed95-b1a2-4439-b580-ba2855dc0067"">


```suggestion
  background-color: var(--quaternary-color) !important;
  border-color: var(--quaternary-color);
``` We can just merge these lines, and remove the test ID from the component as well.

```suggestion
    await expect(page.getByText('translations.landing['big-heading-1-b']')).toBeVisible();
``` Instead of inline styles, could we style this element using CSS classes? Same here. I think this row should be a `ul` since the content is a list of companies.

```suggestion
      <ul
``` That would be a good optimization. I think the placement of the text is also important. So I altered the test to look for an h1. 
If this method is approved, we could replace all of the heading tests and remove their test id Since our buttons retain their border color on hover, this one could stay.  ```suggestion
```
I don't think we need this. This is quite a broad change. Do we definitely want to hit every body? Is this just for testing purposes? Nice work, man. It's working beautifully now. It's fine, I don't think it's worth changing, but testing the page layout via playwright feels a little excessive. The way I think about it is this: we're primarily interested in knowing ""is the appropriate landing page showing, given the growthbook setup + cookies?"".

It's enough to know _that_ the page changes. e.g. check that `big-heading-1-b` appears when we're expecting variation B, but not when we're expecting A.

As I said, it doesn't seem worth changing, but I would recommend that in future. yes, otherwise we should pass the uri env from github and include it in the sample.env (so contributors could load the landing page), and perhaps intercept the fetch call in the test, etc. I will double check, but otherwise we would have a horizontally scrolling landing page.  Okay, that sounds good. Could you add a quick comment explaining that? Applied the change to landing-b class.  ```suggestion
				// Defaults are added to facilitate testing, and avoid passing the related env
        growthbook.setFeatures(defaultGrowthBookFeatures);
``` comment has been added."

","```suggestion
To begin the project, use the `.getElementById()` method to retrieve the `#message-input`, `#result`, and `#check-message-btn` elements from the HTML document, and assign them to the variables `messageInput`, `result`, and `checkMessageButton`, respectively.
``` ```suggestion
Attach an event listener to your `checkMessageButton`, listening for the `click` event. Give it an empty callback function.
``` ```suggestion
Regular expressions can take <dfn>flags</dfn> to modify their behavior. For instance, the `i` flag can be used to make the expression ignore case, causing it to match `hello`, `HELLO`, and `Hello` for the expression `/hello/`.
``` ```suggestion
The <dfn>alternate sequence</dfn> `|` can be used to match either the text on the left or the text on the right of the `|`. For example, the regular expression `/yes|no/` will match either `yes` or `no`.
``` ```suggestion
Update your `helpRegex` to match either `please help` or `assist me`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `helpRegex` should match the string `please help`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `helpRegex` should match the string `assist me`.
``` ```suggestion
Start by declaring a `dollarRegex` variable, and assign it a case-insensitive regular expression that matches the text `dollars`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `dollarRegex` should match `dollars`.
``` ```suggestion
You need to match a number before the text `dollars`. While you could write out `0|1|2` and so on, regular expressions have a feature that makes this easier.
``` ```suggestion
A <dfn>character class</dfn> is defined by square brackets, and matches any character within the brackets. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any character in the list `aeiou`. You can also define a range of characters to match using a hyphen. For example, `[a-z]` matches any character from `a` to `z`.
``` ```suggestion
Add a character class to match the digits `0` through `9` to your `dollarRegex` expression - remember the digit must come before the word `dollars`, and there should be a space between the digit and the word.
``` ```suggestion
Your `dollarRegex` should match `1 dollars`.
``` ```suggestion
The dollar value may be more than one digit. To match this, the `+` quantifier can be used - this matches one or more consecutive occurrences. For example, the regular expression `/a+/` matches one or more consecutive `a` characters.
``` ```suggestion
Your `dollarRegex` should match `100 dollars`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `dollarRegex` should match `3 dollars`.
``` ```suggestion
A <dfn>capture group</dfn> is a way to define a part of the expression that should be captured and saved for later reference. You can define a capture group by wrapping a part of your expression in parentheses. For example, `/h(i|ey) camper/` would match either `hi camper` or `hey camper`, and would capture `i` or `ey` in a group.
``` ```suggestion
Now that you have your capture group, you can mark the entire pattern as an optional match. The `?` quantifier matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group. For example, the regular expression `/colou?r/` matches both `color` and `colour`, because the `u` is optional.
``` ```suggestion
To create a non-capturing group in a regular expression, you can add `?:` after the opening parenthesis of a group. For instance, `(?:a|b)` will match either `a` or `b`, but it will not capture the result.
``` ```suggestion
Your next regular expression will look for strings like `free money`. Start by declaring a `freeRegex` variable and assigning it a regular expression that will match the string `free money`. Remember to make it case-insensitive.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should match `free money`.
``` ```suggestion
Replace the `e` characters in your regular expression with character classes that match `e` and `3`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should use a character class to match `e` and `3`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should use three character classes to match `e` and `3`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should match `free money`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should match `fr33 mon3y`.
``` ```suggestion
Now update your `o` character to match `o` and `0` (the digit).
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should use a character class to match `o` and `0`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should match `free money`.
``` ```suggestion
Your `freeRegex` should match `fr33 m0n3y`.

<details>
<summary>**Friendly Pointers (click to expand)**</summary>

1. **Editing on GitHub:** While it's possible to edit files directly on GitHub, it's typically better not to. This helps avoid inadvertent mistakes like typos that can disrupt tests.

2. **Pull Request Title:** Please ensure the PR title follows [our convention](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/how-to-open-a-pull-request/#prepare-a-good-pr-title).

3. **Linking Issues:** Please ensure you link issues using the designated method. Simply update the `XXXXXX` in the PR description to include the issue number. This keeps our records organized and clear.

4. **Engaging with the Team:** We know you're eager, but kindly keep mentions and review requests limited. Our maintainers are always on the lookout and will attend to PRs in the order they come in.

5. **Branch Management:** It's a good practice not to work directly off your `main` branch. Creating separate branches for different changes allows you to smoothly update your PR even as the main repository progresses.

This pull request updates the hint text in step 13 and step 34 of the ""Implementing the Luhn Algorithm"" challenge within the Scientific Computing with Python curriculum. The original hint text stated ""You could have,"" which has been corrected to ""You should have"" to provide clearer guidance to learners.

There's no need to send signed in users through the auth flow. This recreates the behaviour of `ifUserRedirect` from the api-server.

Also, I removed the authenticate fallback. It's possible to keep it and add the `redirectIfSignedIn` decorator separately, but the fact it's already making things harder than they should be made me rethink the approach. We'll just have to be careful!

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->
","This seems contradictory: Register `redirectIfSignedIn`, if user is signed out. Also, correct me if I am wrong, but the old api does not have `redirectIfSignedIn` for `/auth/auth0/callback`, but this adds it to the new api.

I am not sure when that would happen, but it does seem like a change. Is this contradictory? The idea was these routes are for signed out users only, so if you're signed in, then it should send you away.

> old api does not have redirectIfSignedIn for /auth/auth0/callback, but this adds it to the new api.

Fair point, I'll make it more focused and add TODOs to go back to this once we're confident that nothing breaks. > The idea was these routes are for signed out users only, so if you're signed in, then it should send you away.

What route is available to non-signed in users, but not signed-in users? Just `/signin`? Also `mobile-login`. I just wanted to add the plugin first. Yeah, looking at this again, I am not sure we should have cared about something like `/auth/...`"

Right. The idea is to make the GQL queries a little more direct, so it shouldn't change anything anything significant. We're still fetching the same data at the same time (minus the bits we didn't use).

So, the build changes slightly (might be a bit faster, idk), but what gets built is the same.How does this play with our redirects? LGTM üëç

The main change is to make the page data fetching more direct. In all cases we know the id of the page we're building before we try to fetch its data, so we can use it. The slug was working, but this is simpler.

In the process I found a few other bits of dead code.

I like the sound of all that. Definitely ""Nice to have"", though. I would agree with Tom and we should change the label ""Here's a preview of what you will build"" at the top to ""Here's an example of a project that fulfills the user stories.""
 
Also is this change specifically for labs?

 @zairahira the change to the label makes sense, but I'd prefer to do that in a followup PR.

> Also is this change specifically for labs?

It's intended to be used by labs, but it's quite general. If you want to show the demo (i.e. the solution to the last challenge), then you can do that on any challenge by setting the `demoType` property. The value `workshop` vs `labs` determines if it will be shown automatically or if we should show a button to show it.

Given that, I think it makes sense to change the values from `workshop` and `labs` to `onLoad` and `onClick` respectively. That better reflects what they are, rather how they're used. Does that make sense? I went ahead and changed the names. Happy to revert/change if people hate them. I tested the `onLoad` and `onClick` functionality and it's working perfectly fine üëçÔ∏è So, the workshops are not supposed to show the preview on the first step? It should be configurable. If you add `demoType` to the frontmatter of a challenge then it should show a demo. Either automatically, if you use `onLoad`, or when you click the button, if you use `onClick`.

So, it's up to whoever creates a lesson to decide which, if any, they want.  #55569 <https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/55569>

The modal that shows up for the labs says ""Here's a preview of what you will build"" at the top. I think we should change that to something else - maybe ""Here's an example of a project that fulfills the user stories."" And it says ""Start Coding!"" at the bottom. That doesn't feel quite right either, maybe just ""Code"". Also we probably want something in the instruction panel around that button, ""Build a project that is functionally similar to this: button""

I don't think any of that needs to be added here, this adds the main functionality and isn't visible anywhere except the new labs - we can make subsequent PR's later.

Thinking about this now, I wonder if we could use that portal for all these. I would think so. That would probably be better. We don't need to change it now, but at some point, maybe we can move to that.

Edit: This seems to have broken the project view in the settings/timeline/portfolio. When I click ""view project"" on one of those, the preview is blank.

Edit: Actually, it seems to be working. I'm not sure why it wasn't showing up right away. I made some changes, and it showed up - then I reverted them to what's on this PR and it worked.

Not really. I also saw it, but in the database logs, the connection shows up as ""unified"". I am quite sure this is coming from the `connect-mongo` setup. See:

Version 4.2.0 (our version) doesn't know what `useUnifiedTopology` is, so it drops it. Version 5.5.0 keeps it.

Hi @gikf , thank you for letting me know. Sure, I'll update this shortly based on your comment. :) Hi @gikf ,
For some reasons, I was not able to edit this branch, so I made a new branch and PR.
Here is the new PR link for your information.

Hi @gikf ,

I'm experiencing some git issues.
There is no specific error message.
I can see the changes in my dev environment, but I can't see this in PR.
When I type 'git status', I got this message: 'nothing to commit, working tree clean'.
I think there may be something wrong with the push. I tried to solve this issue, but so far nothing has worked.
That's why I created a new branch and a new PR.
Can you please give me some insight on this?

I found an issue while I'm pushing the code. Gitpod indicates me an issue and I knew where to start fixing it.
Here is the error for your reference.
